/* Minimal reproducer for the breakable_surfaces cross-product operand tie.

   Faithful to _breakable_surface_effect: BOTH cross operands are stack
   locals (surface_plane is filled by a call, s_normal is computed), and the
   two plane constructions follow the cross, so the s_plane.n = s_normal
   copy can be scheduled into the cross-product code.

   January emits, for the two products containing s_normal.k:
     fld <plane member>; fmul <s_normal.k>
   our build emits the operands the other way round.  */
