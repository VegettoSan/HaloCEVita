# `libs/libcmt/wcscat.obj` — MATCHING

**Status: byte-exact. Both symbols, whole object.**
**Lane:** `claude/libcmt-stream` · **Object status in `config/config.json`:** `Matching`

**Toolchain:** XDK 3911 `CL.Exe` 13.00.9254.1 · **Flags:** `/O1 /Gy /I"xbox/include"`
**Start state:** 0.00% — object `MISSING`, no source.

| symbol | target | ours | exact |
|---|--:|--:|:--:|
| `_wcscat` | 42 B / 0 rel | 42 B / 0 rel | **yes** |
| `_wcscpy` | 28 B / 0 rel | 28 B / 0 rel | **yes** |

`section_infos_equal` passes for both. Normalized SHA-256:
`_wcscat` `2794a8ea379ab443…`, `_wcscpy` `400344dea9c2f17d…`.
With zero relocations in either function the `.text` sections are literally
byte-identical, not merely equal under masking.

---

## 1. Two functions, one translation unit

The object defines **both** `_wcscat` and `_wcscpy`, in two `/Gy` COMDAT `.text`
sections. There is no `libs/libcmt/wcscpy` unit in `config/config.json` — the CRT
keeps `wcscpy` in `WCSCAT.C`, and the object confirms it. Section order is
`wcscat` then `wcscpy`, which is the source order.

No externals and no data sections: the whole object is these two leaf functions.

## 2. Shapes recovered from the disassembly

**`_wcscat`** — note the scan loop is *rotated*: the target tests `*cp` once up
front (`cmp word ptr [eax],0` / `je`) and then runs a `do`-style body
(`inc; inc; cmp; jne`). That is what a plain `while (*cp) cp++;` compiles to at
`/O1`, so no special shaping was needed.

```
 0  mov eax,[esp+4]      ; dst -- also the return value, never clobbered
 4  cmp word ptr [eax],0
 8  mov edx,eax          ; cp = dst
 a  je 0x14
 c  inc edx / inc edx    ; cp++
 e  cmp word ptr [edx],0
12  jne 0xc
14  push esi
15  mov esi,[esp+0xc]    ; src (esp+8, +4 for the push)
19  mov cx,[esi]         ; while (*cp++ = *src++)
1c  mov [edx],cx
1f  inc edx / inc edx
21  inc esi / inc esi
23  test cx,cx
26  jne 0x19
28  pop esi
29  ret
```

The return value needs no code at all: `dst` is loaded into EAX at offset 0 and
EAX is never touched afterwards (the function works in EDX/ECX/ESI), so `return
dst;` costs nothing. Writing it any other way — caching `dst` in a local, or
returning `cp` — would have produced a reload.

**`_wcscpy`** is the same copy loop without the scan, and does reload
`mov eax,[esp+4]` at the end because EAX is used as the character temp.

Neither function uses a frame pointer; both address arguments off ESP directly.

## 3. Source

```c
typedef unsigned short wchar_t;

wchar_t * __cdecl wcscat(wchar_t *dst, const wchar_t *src)
{
	wchar_t *cp = dst;

	while (*cp)
		cp++;					/* find end of dst */

	while (*cp++ = *src++)
		;						/* Copy src to end of dst */

	return dst;
}

wchar_t * __cdecl wcscpy(wchar_t *dst, const wchar_t *src)
{
	wchar_t *cp = dst;

	while (*cp++ = *src++)
		;						/* Copy src over dst */

	return dst;
}
```

`wchar_t` is declared locally as `unsigned short` — in C mode MSVC does not treat
it as a keyword, and pulling in a header for it is unnecessary here since the
object has no other dependencies.

Byte-exact on the first build; no iteration was required.

## 4. Notes for the rest of libcmt

* The `/O1 /Gy` recipe established by the `stream` work in this lane is what makes
  these objects buildable; `wcscat` is the first libcmt object to come out fully
  matching.
* Leaf string functions like this are the cheapest wins in the project: no
  relocations, no externals, no data, and the whole shape is legible from a
  40-byte disassembly. The neighbouring `wcs*` units (`wcslen`, `wcschr`,
  `wcscmp`, `wcsncat`, `wcsncpy`, `wcsrchr`, `wcsspn`, …) are all still `MISSING`
  and are very likely the same profile.
* Watch for units that quietly contain more than one function, as this one does.
  Check the target's symbol table before assuming a one-to-one mapping between
  the config entry and the function.

## 5. Current-campaign revalidation and house audit

The object was independently rebuilt after transplanting it onto campaign tip
`f1c6f1f4`. Ninja launched XDK 3911 `CL.Exe` normally with the generated
`/O1 /Gy /I"xbox/include"` command line. Both functions again passed
`section_infos_equal` with the sizes, hashes, and zero-relocation tables shown
above. The complete Halo tree and the configured libcmt target both built
successfully.

The target owns only the two external function COMDATs; it owns no writable or
read-only data. The candidate's additional `.drectve` and debug sections are
ordinary compiler metadata and do not claim target runtime content.

House/Berth review: the implementation is readable C, parameters are vertically
formatted, and both functions return their declared values directly. It adds no
assembly, volatility, forced inlining, undefined behavior, alignment directive,
raw offset, byte patch, comparator exception, or compiler-flag workaround. No
original behavioral bug was identified in this translation unit.
