# `encounters.obj` Jonas actor-iterator initialization leaf

## Result

This bounded wave starts from clean canonical commit
`c8ab755c312be6e9c4eb3cd0d9e6c6aba643c45e`. Four ordinary-cdecl,
typed-C encounter/actor iterator candidates were emitted together in exactly
one natural code-producing compile. `_actor_iterator_new` was independently
strict on that first object and is retained. The other three bodies were
removed unchanged, together with support used only by those misses; none was
tuned, reshaped, or compiled a second time.

`source/ai/encounters.obj` advances from 9/61 to 10/61 strict functions and
remains `NonMatching`. The retained gain is 57 meaningful / 64 padded code
bytes and three relocations.

| Candidate | Target meaningful / padded | Target relocs | Target normalized SHA-256 | First natural candidate | Disposition |

  The repository's natural `/nologo /c /O2 /Oy- /DDEBUG /Dxbox` command,
  include order, and XDK 3911 environment are unchanged.

The fail-closed signature packet is:

```c
long encounter_get_by_name(char const *encounter_name);
struct actor_datum *encounter_actor_iterator_prev(
    struct encounter_actor_iterator *iterator);
void actor_iterator_new(
    struct actor_iterator *iterator,
    boolean active_only);
struct actor_datum *actor_iterator_next(
    struct actor_iterator *iterator);
```

All four names use ordinary leading-underscore C decoration, external
storage class 2, function type 32, and caller-cleanup cdecl. HCEA's `int`
return for `encounter_get_by_name` is the same target-width 32-bit C type as
this repository's `long`; HCEA's `uint8_t active_only` is the same unsigned
byte representation as `boolean`. No private register ABI is inferred.

## January correction and typed layout

HCEA supplies the readable named behavior and the complete 0x1C iterator
layout. The distinct January-PC artifact is a readable reconstruction from PC
disassembly, not authentic source. Before the one-shot experiment it supplied
the independently versioned store table `+0x10 = 0`, `+0x18 = -1`,
`+0x14 = -1`, then `+0x11 = flag`; that order differs from the HCEA Xbox
source sequence. The PC file accidentally labels the initializer
`encounter_iterator_next`, but its RVA commentary, 0x1C layout, call to
`data_iterator_new`, and documented store table identify the actor
initializer; the January target PDB resolves the real name as
`_actor_iterator_new`.

The first natural candidate used that PC-correlated readable assignment order
as semantic reconstruction evidence: clear the phase, invalidate next and
current handles, then publish the caller's filter byte. The order was frozen
before candidate emission from a separate-version artifact, not selected by
observing candidate bytes or by retrying a target-driven code-generation
matrix. Its role is corroboration for the semantic statement order, not an
authentic-source or compiler-emission claim.

The translation-unit-local typed iterator contains the existing 0x10-byte
`struct data_iterator`, `iterated_encounterless_list` at `+0x10`,
`active_only` at `+0x11`, two explicit padding bytes, `index` at `+0x14`, and
`next_index` at `+0x18`; compile-time assertions freeze every offset and the
0x1C total size. The previously accepted typed AI-globals prefix remains
unchanged and asserts `ai_initialized_for_map` at `+0x01`.

When AI is not initialized the retained function leaves the caller's cursor
untouched. Otherwise it initializes the embedded encounter-data iterator,
clears the encounterless phase byte, sets both handles to `NONE`, and copies
the caller's active-only byte. It uses the repository's existing typed
`data_iterator_new`, `encounter_data`, and `ai_globals` declarations directly.
There is no cast, raw address, pointer arithmetic, byte-offset access, union
pun, inactive-union read, uninitialized read, signed-overflow dependency,
aliasing violation, assembly, `volatile` scheduling device, optimizer pragma,
forced-inline annotation, synthetic anchor, or byte-forcing expression.

The local struct tag creates no cross-translation-unit C type collision. The
repository has no conflicting header prototype, live source declaration, or
second compiled definition. January COFF has the unique definition in
`encounters.obj`; `_actor_iterator_new` and `_actor_iterator_next` are
undefined in `actors.obj`, `ai.obj`, `ai_communication.obj`, `ai_debug.obj`,
`ai_profile.obj`, and `ai_script.obj`, while the other two quartet names are
undefined only in `ai_debug.obj`. The pointer and byte argument ABI agrees
with HCEA's shared iterator header and those callers. Reachable history has
the earlier six encounter iterator/setter bodies and symbol-list comments,
but no prior retained implementation of this exact initializer sequence.

## Fail-closed omissions and ownership boundary

The three nonexact quartet symbols are absent from the retained object. The
nine inherited strict bodies remain exact: the three encounter lifecycle
functions, encounter iterator new/next, encounter-actor iterator new/next,
and the blind/deaf setters. Source placement keeps every inherited accepted
COMDAT fingerprint unchanged; only the new function-owned code/debug/symbol
records appear.

Additional candidates were explicitly rejected before this wave:
`encounter_force_activate`, `encounter_force_deactivate`, and
`encounter_set_respawn` depend on private EAX helper ABIs;
`actors_freeze` carries an HCEA-only phantom second argument;
`actor_move_halt_at_firing_position` uses raw layout casts; and the perceived-
enemy helper depends on a private register convention. None is implemented,
declared, credited, or used to widen this wave.

Only `source/ai/encounters.c` and this new Jonas-owned ledger change. No
shared header, configuration, semantic exception, parked record, completion
label, pre-existing Markdown, Claude-owned file, protected-five source, or
tracked-path deletion is in scope. The protected five are `vehicles.c`,
`ai_debug.c`, `ai_script.c`, `actions.c`, and `units.c`.

This wave adds no `.bss`, writable `.data`, runtime `.rdata`, COMMON owner,
literal owner, or data credit. `ai_globals` remains a typed undefined external;
the pre-existing encounter-data storage owner is unchanged. Direct section
and symbol-set comparison confirms that the only non-code delta is compiler
debug information associated with the new COMDAT.

## Validation

- Complete Halo plus libcmt graph: pass. The retained-subset graph is clean;
  the final incremental invocation reports no work.
- Direct hardened COFF comparison: all ten accepted functions have exact
  padded bytes, normalized hashes, relocation offsets/types/destinations, and
  addends. All three rejected quartet symbols are absent.
- `ninja progress`: pass. The semantic audit scans 470 units and 4,113
  functions, reports 3,973 semantic exact, 101 hidden exact / 61,876 hidden
  code bytes, 4,034 accepted exact, 36 ordinary-only, 35 structurally
  accepted, one rejected, and zero unit errors.
- Campaign progress: 375/833 matched objects, 4,021/11,060 functions,
  479,605/2,198,102 meaningful code bytes, and
  1,835,088/4,176,062 data bytes. Halo contributes 273/468 objects,
  3,854/7,574 functions, and 466,691/1,770,166 code bytes; libcmt contributes
  102/212 objects, 167/476 functions, and 12,914/55,015 code bytes.
- Object admission: zero candidates and zero revocations; only the inherited
  `source/shell/shell_xbox` completion-label contradiction remains.
- Parked validation: three active, zero stale, and zero invalid entries.
- Complete tooling suite: 179/179 tests pass; `git diff --check` is clean.
- The frozen pre-wave one-unit gate identifies exactly
  `_actor_iterator_new` as `NEWLY_EXACT`, retains all nine inherited bodies as
  `still_exact`, and reports `changed_nonexact: []`. Its only structural
  findings are the expected `.debug$S` and symbol-set additions for the new
  COMDAT; no runtime code/data drift or adjudication is present.
- A clean committed-state one-unit snapshot/check, deletion of the committed
  `encounters.obj`, same-path forced rebuild, second check, and direct hardened
  comparison reproduce all ten accepted functions with the three misses still
  absent and no runtime storage delta.

Nothing is pushed.
