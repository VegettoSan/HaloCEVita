# `files_windows.obj` Codex checkpoint

This Codex-owned ledger records the bounded recovery of
`source/tag_files/files_windows.obj`. The unit remains `NonMatching`: seven
functions, the 624-byte file-search aggregate, and eleven residual strings are
still absent. No pre-existing or Claude-authored Markdown was edited or
deleted.

## Scope and donor

- Integration base: `9584608e7d09cbe8cb126fb73886eba4740b585e`.
- The source-only donor chain is `7dfc5550`, `20cd95ea`, `9e7a38c0`,
  `93c8cf48`, and `62466e86`. Its final source blob is
  `62c2b361e6707cd64c39440aa57479c553542010`.
- Only `source/tag_files/files_windows.c` is implemented. No shared header,
  configuration, semantic ledger, or park entry changes.
- The user-frozen `vehicles`, `ai_debug`, `ai_script`, `actions`, and `units`
  objects are outside this lane and untouched.

## Strict code result

The untouched base had 8/27 strict-exact functions, 580 meaningful bytes,
640 padded bytes, and 29 relocations. The forced donor build has 20/27
strict-exact functions, 2,217 meaningful bytes, 2,368 padded bytes, and 131
relocations. The strict gain is therefore 12 functions, 1,637 meaningful
bytes, 1,728 padded bytes, and 102 relocations. All eight baseline-exact
functions remain exact.

The seven residual functions are fail-closed and absent from the candidate:
`_find_files_start` (204/208 bytes, 17 relocations), `_file_path_split`
(213/224, 2), `_file_open` (391/400, 23), `_file_read` (168/176, 13),
`_file_write` (161/176, 12), `_file_get_size` (209/224, 13), and
`_find_files_next` (499/512, 49). No residual body is retained or credited.

Nineteen exact functions have matching whole-symbol type and storage. The
private `_code_00189ca0` section has exact bytes and relocations, but the
target split symbol has external storage class 2 while the legal source-static
definition has class 3. This checkpoint does not claim whole-symbol ownership
for that helper.

## Strict data and ownership boundary

The target owns 27 runtime non-code sections: a 624-byte DATA aggregate and
26 RDATA strings, totaling 1,299 logical bytes. The baseline owned 3 exact
strings totaling 152 bytes. The donor owns 15 exact strings totaling 337
bytes and zero relocations, a gain of 12 sections and 185 logical bytes.

| Exact payload | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| `d:\\` | 4 |
| `path && full_path` | 18 |
| `file_set_position` | 18 |
| `file_get_position` | 18 |
| shared file-error format | 22 |
| `file_get_last_modification_date` | 32 |
| January source path | 41 |
| path/name assertion | 53 |
| path/extension assertion | 58 |
| `file_close` | 11 |
| `file_delete` | 12 |
| `file_create` | 12 |
| `file_exists` | 12 |
| `file_get_eof` | 13 |
| `file_set_eof` | 13 |

The 962-byte open boundary is the 624-byte aggregate plus eleven strings
owned only by omitted residuals. Candidate debug/directive sections receive no
runtime credit. Three unchanged XDK `SELECT_ANY` constants total 432 bytes;
they are the same unreferenced duplicate COMDATs present at the baseline and
also receive no target ownership credit. Target/candidate symbol inventories
are 148/111 entries.

## Regression and gates

The baseline regression manifest was captured from a forced clean build at
`9584608e`. The donor makes twelve functions newly exact and adds their exact
strings and symbols. Three baseline callers now relocate to same-name local
definitions instead of unresolved externals: `_file_read_only` calls
`_file_location_get_full_path`, while `_file_read_from_position` and
`_file_write_to_position` call `_file_set_position`. Their code, padded size,
relocation addresses/types/destinations, and strict target equality are
unchanged. The other five baseline functions are unchanged under the complete
regression fingerprint. The expected additive data/symbol transition was
reviewed rather than waived; a new clean post-commit manifest freezes the
accepted checkpoint.

Full `halobetacache_build` and `libcmt_build` graphs pass. Semantic audit
reports 470 units, 3,775 functions evaluated, 3,641 semantic exact, 3,705
accepted exact, and zero unit errors. Campaign progress is 375/833 objects,
3,698/11,060 functions, 450,589/2,198,102 code bytes, and
1,803,124/4,176,062 data bytes. Admission reports zero candidates and zero
revocations, with only the inherited `source/shell/shell_xbox`
contradiction. Parked audit reports three active, zero stale, and zero
invalid. The complete tool suite passes 179/179 tests.

The retained source is ordinary typed C: no assembly, volatile scheduling
device, forced inline, optimizer pragma/barrier, undefined type-punning, raw
byte access, or byte forcing. Parameter formatting and explicit void returns
follow the project rules. The unit remains `NonMatching` and no GitHub push is
performed.

## Const-corrective follow-up

A later policy audit found ten call-site casts that discarded `const` solely
to reach the legacy `file_reference_get_info` API. That API's implementation
only validates the reference fields and returns the same storage; it performs
no write. The corrective source therefore confines the unavoidable legacy
conversion to one TU-local accessor boundary, immediately converts the result
to `struct file_reference_info const *`, and exposes no writable pointer. All
five const public paths and the private error reporter now retain const views
throughout. A raw-cast audit finds no remaining call-site conversion; the one
documented conversion is the accessor boundary itself.

The forced XDK rebuild preserves all 20/27 strict-exact functions, including
the six directly affected sections, with unchanged normalized hashes, padded
sizes, and relocation semantics. The pre-correction regression manifest
reports all 20 accepted functions `still_exact`, no changed nonexact function,
no newly exact function, and no runtime data or symbol-ownership change. The
only object delta is compiler type information in `.debug$S`, as expected from
making every local reference-info view const; it receives no runtime matching
credit. The 15 exact owned strings (337 bytes) and the unit's 20/27 code result
are unchanged.
