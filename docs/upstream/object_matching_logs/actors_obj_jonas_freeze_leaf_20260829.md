# `actors.obj` January freeze leaf

## Result

`_actors_freeze` matches in the first and only natural production candidate.
It contributes 62 meaningful / 64 padded code bytes and four ordered
relocations. `source/ai/actors.obj` advances from 25/76 to 26/76 strict
functions and remains `NonMatching`.

The target and candidate normalized SHA-256 is
`f689e2ee11a8c1958103b166c7970cd015cf4eecbe11990c32f92ce61f3fda52`.
Their relocation packets are identical:

- `+0x0D`: i386 `REL32` to `_actor_iterator_new`;
- `+0x16`: i386 `REL32` to `_actor_iterator_next`;
- `+0x26`: i386 `REL32` to `_code_00029e70`;
- `+0x2F`: i386 `REL32` to `_actor_iterator_next`.

The immutable first-shot object is
`build/audit/actors_freeze_first_shot_20260829.obj`, 9,306 bytes, SHA-256
`3e443b36ca544e2d33c759e9bfe117ab697b33a3acc44a64577d72a1f19f8e06`.
The January split object is 56,916 bytes, SHA-256
`632a2b344e779e5d58e4d9e8e881700d8d106d51fdc3b74cc731aff9e7c3d9b9`.

## Retained source and layout

The pre-wave `source/ai/actors.c` blob is
`0fa2c2b6b482ae7abb0c4e609c8cf826c0a67afd`; the retained blob is
`af5a9f90b5ca8480edd18bf13f013b6028728d4f`. The complete function body is:

```c
void actors_freeze(
	void)
{
	struct actor_iterator iterator;

	actor_iterator_new(&iterator, TRUE);
	while (actor_iterator_next(&iterator))
	{
		code_00029e70(iterator.index);
	}

	return;
}
```

The translation-unit-local typed iterator is the already authenticated 0x1C
layout used by `ai.c`, `ai_communication.c`, `ai_debug.c`, and `encounters.c`:
an embedded 0x10 `data_iterator`, two boolean fields, two pad bytes, `index` at
`+0x14`, and `next_index` at `+0x18`. Compile-time assertions freeze the total
size and the only accessed field offset. The public `actor_iterators.h`
prototypes provide the ordinary cdecl ABI; no shared-header definition or ABI
change is introduced.

## January and cross-build evidence

The complete January COMDAT disassembly fixes a 0x1C stack iterator,
`actor_iterator_new(&iterator, TRUE)`, a top-tested iterator loop, the actor
handle load from `[ebp-8]` (`iterator.index`), and one call to
`code_00029e70` per live actor. Its terminal `ret` is at `+0x3D`, followed by
two NOPs. The retained typed loop emits that complete topology, instruction
stream, padding, and relocation schedule naturally.

An independent January-PC reconstruction at commit
`918af885935ec470a31256ecce9a977b12b01f80`, source blob
`ecf9bb77905c2950e9941038ff82a5eee3712282`, independently records the same
0x1C iterator, active-only flag, iterator-next loop, `index` load at `+0x14`,
and per-actor helper call. Its source payload SHA-256 is
`0105cdaf6f2c3c11e382b018920307fecf9c9057dfe887db0cd0e4b1c7b8600d`.
That file is readable reverse-engineering evidence, not authentic source; its
anonymous helper labels and raw-array spelling were not transplanted.

The clean HCEA reference at commit
`c168af2e747d3095d9a29418ae401f3a39544863`, `actors_freeze.c` blob
`e619f5e4bace1d80e9dfea4f0d078066731615e2`, authenticates the public name,
no-argument signature, 0x1C actor iterator, active-only iteration, and
freeze-every-live-actor semantics. Its later Xbox body expands the per-actor
operation inline and carries a documented phantom helper argument. That
cross-build difference was treated as a version boundary. January's split
object and the independently agreeing January-PC reconstruction are
authoritative for the short helper-call topology.

## History, documentation, and one-shot boundary

All four actor-specific ledgers were read completely before mutation:

- `actors_obj_codex_checkpoint.md`;
- `actors_obj_jonas_maintenance_pair_20260821.md`;
- `actors_obj_jonas_reset_leaf_first_shot_20260826.md`;
- `actors_obj_jonas_public_leaf_batch_20260829.md`.

The encounter-iterator ledger was also read because it previously rejected
this function before the January-PC helper topology had been established. It
contains no candidate body or compile for `_actors_freeze`; the reachable
source history, ledger census, and registered-worktree census likewise found
no earlier production attempt. This wave therefore consumes the function's
first candidate.

The campaign `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, matching methodology, acceleration
playbook, verification and snapshot policies, prototype/ABI references,
knowledge-base policy, object tooling documentation, current actor types, and
the pinned VC7/XDK build contract were applied. They require complete padded
COFF bytes plus ordered relocations and prohibit byte forcing, source-shape
sweeps, compiler control, raw offsets, address transplants, punning, undefined
behavior, and knowledge-base exceptions.

The typed structure, include, assertions, and one natural loop were applied
together. The ordinary production `actors.obj` edge compiled exactly once.
The strict comparator passed immediately; there was no declaration, control-
flow, source-shape, flag, or compiler retry.

## Acceptance and scope

`python -m tools.campaign.gate source/ai/actors --all` reports 26 exact, zero
residual, and 50 unwritten functions. Direct hardened comparison passes the
new leaf and all 25 inherited accepted actor functions.

The tracked implementation scope is only `source/ai/actors.c`; this ledger is
the sole documentation addition. The retained code is readable typed
C89-style source with explicit return. It contains no assembly, `volatile`,
`register`, pragma, intrinsic, compiler attribute, barrier, raw address or
offset access, pointer/integer reconstruction, pointer or union pun, undefined
behavior, synthetic anchor, or object-byte forcing.

Units, Vehicles, Matrix Math, AI Debug, campaign configuration, semantic
exceptions, parked records, completion labels, and build rules are untouched.
Full cumulative build, semantic, progress, admission, park, protected-Units,
and test evidence is recorded after the implementation-and-ledger commit.

## Committed cumulative validation

The implementation-and-ledger commit is
`c4dd400802d8e95019f094143c9cdca0dce54f70`. From that committed source,
the complete Halo and libcmt graphs, report, semantic report, and progress
generation pass. The canonical outputs are:

- `build/report.json`: 1,599,060 bytes, SHA-256
  `8f6b39f8d4a96a706570f4055b93e4554dc70214eede9bdc69fe5911f3fb1117`;
- `build/semantic_report.json`: 3,267,705 bytes, SHA-256
  `e9a9aa1f1044a58634547bba4dbba90029fdadfbe0cfc061bd9450b2bdaf3691`.

The semantic audit scans 470 units and evaluates 4,919 functions: 4,802
semantic exact, 131 hidden exact / 78,940 hidden code bytes, one ordinary-
only, one structural, zero rejected, 12 local skips, 2,810 missing, 4,812
accepted exact, and zero unit errors.

Campaign progress is 384/833 linked objects, 4,773/11,060 functions, 606,332
of 2,198,102 code bytes, and 1,856,050 of 4,176,062 data bytes. Admission is
zero candidates, zero contradictions, and zero revocations. Parks remain 12
active, zero stale, and zero invalid. All 212 tooling tests pass.

The protected Units sentinel `_unit_preprocess_node_orientations` remains
strict exact at 1,920 padded bytes, 87 ordered relocations, and normalized
SHA-256
`5d5c8edc492fb8ab6ea83e1ccaa4cb2798da51ae4a17182fa848878bed05a7ed`.
The tracked worktree is clean apart from the pre-existing untracked
`scratch/` research directory.
