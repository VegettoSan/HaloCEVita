# circular_queue.obj exact-match strategy ledger

## Scope and required toolchain

- Translation unit: `source/memory/circular_queue.c`
- Target: January 2002 `source/memory/circular_queue.obj`
- Compiler: XDK 3911 CL 13.00.9254.1
- Flags: `/O2 /Oy- /DDEBUG /Dxbox`
- Strict gate: `tools/coff_compare.py` / `section_infos_equal`
- Detailed experiment transcript:
  `research/circular_queue_obj/EXPERIMENTS.md`

No inline assembly, volatile byte forcing, undefined behavior, object-byte
patching, compiler-flag changes, or fuzzy-match credit was used.

## Validated baseline

Seven of eight functions are strict exact:

| Function | Target/base size | Relocs | Normalized SHA-256 | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| `circular_queue_reset` | 16/16 | 0/0 | `43bd388fa461cee2...` | exact |
| `circular_queue_verify` | 112/112 | 6/6 | `f6a98f7f32feb7df...` | exact |
| `circular_queue_new` | 96/96 | 4/4 | `89dac4b56b758d67...` | exact |
| `circular_queue_delete` | 48/48 | 3/3 | `90fd5b668d0661b3...` | exact |
| `circular_queue_size` | 32/32 | 1/1 | `691530e94ba7f3f2...` | exact |
| `circular_queue_free_space` | 48/48 | 1/1 | `fa1cb9aa5c44d00d...` | exact |
| `circular_queue_queue_data` | 240/240 | 12/12 | `cfe1f5adce7a13f3...` | exact |
| `circular_queue_dequeue_data` | 256/240 | 12/12 | target `2981341a22238a314c0f885d555149dc279257b6109242e674f38ccfb0ccd1f9`; base `40adf3be1fa79c0b9aaf6b169e37da2e59aa4e306efef68a9573b7aa7ec8dede` | nonexact |

The strict code result is therefore 7/8 functions and 592/848 target padded
code bytes. All five owned `.rdata` COMDATs are raw-byte exact:
46 + 39 + 65 + 52 + 49 = 251/251 bytes. The object owns no `.data` or
`.bss`.

The residual begins at normalized offset `+0x4`; 222 normalized bytes differ.
The first relocation has the correct `_circular_queue_verify` destination
but is at target/base address 14/12. January keeps the queue in `EDI`, the
input size in `ESI`, initializes `BL` to false, later reuses `EBX` for
`read_offset`, and returns `BL` only on failure. Current VC7 instead keeps the
queue in `EBX`, `read_offset` in `EDI`, and folds false directly into `AL`.

## January and cross-build provenance

- The October 2001 XBE function at VA `0x00118fb0` has the same machine
  topology instruction-for-instruction, including `xor bl,bl`, the
  `EBX=read_offset` lifetime reuse, and separate success/failure tails.
- January's PDB exposes the public symbol but no local-variable or line
  records for this function.
- HCEA exposes only the later `simple_circular_queue_*` family and is not a
  source donor for this implementation.
- A campaign-wide target scan found no second strict donor combining early
  byte-zero lifetime materialization with reuse of that register as a later
  long local and a final same-byte failure return.
- The two locally available authentic VC7 compilers, 13.00.9254.1 and
  13.00.9210, emit the same baseline hash from unchanged source.

## Accepted production source

The production source remains the safe semantic reconstruction with one
result local, one success block, an optional `read_offset` writeback, and a
single final return. It preserves all seven exact sibling functions and every
owned data section. No experimental source shape was retained because none
strictly improved the complete translation unit.

## Experiment matrix

Every row was built with the required XDK compiler and flags. Unless stated
otherwise, all seven exact siblings and all five `.rdata` sections remained
exact. Hashes ending in `...` are historical prefixes: the earlier session
did not preserve the full digest, and the experiment was not rerun merely to
lengthen a digest.

## Residual classification

Measured fact: target BL/EBX lifetime is reachable with this compiler (N18),
but every legal-C shape found that creates it also changes the inliner fixed
point and clones the validator, yielding 17 rather than 12 relocations.
Preventing the clone—by noinline, a function boundary, or canonicalized
control flow—simultaneously destroys the lifetime. Address-taking produces a
much closer 256/12 dequeue but globally changes the validator's proven private
ABI and regresses exact siblings.

The best classification is **TU-context optimizer/inliner-allocation fixed
point**, not a proven compiler-QFE difference and not a semantic gap. Because
the current residual has unequal padded sizes, it is research-parked here but
is deliberately **not** admitted to `config/parked.json` under the stricter
equal-size/equal-relocation parking rule.

### 2026-08-30 policy update

The later house rule permits an honest fuzzy park once easy natural matching is
exhausted. The 37-experiment result is therefore now recorded in
`config/parked.json`; the source and measurements are unchanged. This is a
work-queue disposition, not byte-match credit, and the object remains
`NonMatching`.

## Do-not-repeat list

- Do not retry declaration order/scope, `register`, local aliases, scalar
  unions/structs, result increment, reversed comparisons, or result-write
  placement.
- Do not retry single-iteration loops, `while(TRUE)`, `goto`, early returns,
  shared tails, switches, or redundant predicates.
- Do not retry barriers at result or validator sites, validator
  noinline/forceinline/static wrappers, or manual size expansion.
- Do not take the validator's address: it invalidates the exact private ABI
  used by the rest of the translation unit.
- Do not retry function-definition order; both canonical and BL-producing
  control-flow shapes were measured.
- Do not use inline assembly, volatile byte forcing, undefined behavior,
  object-byte patches, altered optimization flags, or fuzzy credit.

## Reopen criteria

Reopen only if one of these appears:

1. January source, line/scope records, or a genuine same-lineage C donor
   reveals a new control topology.
2. A strict-exact donor demonstrates BL/long-register lifetime reuse without
   changing an exact private helper ABI.
3. A distinct authentic Bungie-era VC7 13.00.9254 compiler binary improves
   unchanged source.
4. A tested general compiler control can prevent nested cloning without
   forcing noinline or address-taking.

## Disposition

The safe source is restored and remains 7/8 strict exact with 251/251 owned
data bytes exact. `circular_queue.obj` is **not Matching** and receives no
object credit. The residual is evidence-exhausted under current provenance and
is now machine-readably parked pending one of the explicit reopen criteria.
