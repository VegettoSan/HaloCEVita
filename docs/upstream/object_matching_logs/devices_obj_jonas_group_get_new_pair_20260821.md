# `devices.obj` Jonas group-get/new pair (2026-08-21)

## Result and fixed boundary

This Jonas-owned wave starts from exact clean canonical commit
`c228a83e924b8699dd043ac642c90c5cc27cf56d` on isolated branch
`jonas/devices-group-touch-new-20260821`. The dispatched boundary contained
exactly three ordinary-C bodies. Two were independently strict in the first
and only natural three-body code-producing `devices.obj` candidate compile
and are retained:

| Retained body | January RVA | Meaningful / padded | Relocations | Normalized SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `_device_group_get_value` | `0x00084D20` | `28 / 32` | 2 | `14d2c7728226358605c598e4f2a5a78223c4ed901c5c313792e88985254fd65c` |
| `_device_new` | `0x00084730` | `69 / 80` | 2 | `a82077d5a860161cb67250de07a5a1a827b0c5a07883a4464672a38b8216a901` |

`devices.obj` advances from 7/30 to 9/30 exact functions and from
314/4,463 to 411/4,463 meaningful code bytes. It remains `NonMatching`.
The strict gain is 97 meaningful bytes, 112 padded bytes, and four exact
relocations. No data credit is claimed.

The third fixed body, `_device_touched` at January RVA `0x00084D40`, was a
bounded first-shot miss and is absent from retained source. Its target is
65 meaningful / 80 padded bytes with three relocations and normalized SHA-256
`723eb9fb6ccbf02ce4dbf9d77f10331cb9c43b005e9f2832e2a75598228cda21`.
The immutable natural candidate also emitted 80 padded bytes and three
relocations, but normalized to
`ea9171793c57f04e76b5bb14461778ff0b7e19d55c6ea8b4938cfb89d06f2a10`.
January places the `_control_touched` call relocation at `+0x27`; the natural
typed candidate placed it at `+0x21`. The complete body and its sole
`device_controls.h` support include were removed wholesale. There was no
tuning, declaration reshaping, alternate expression, or second candidate
compile.

The clean HCEA reference is exact commit
`c168af2e747d3095d9a29418ae401f3a39544863`. Each identity below is directly
tree-reachable at that commit, and every SHA-256 is over the raw
`git cat-file blob` payload. HCEA supplies readable intent and layout
corroboration; January PC COFF alone governs acceptance.

All-revision history finds no earlier committed definition of any fixed body.
Earlier devices waves touched disjoint lifecycle, typed-leaf, old-map, and
position-setter scopes. Repository-wide branch/worktree collision checks found
no competing implementation of this trio. The January target defines each
screened external symbol once. `_device_group_change_only_once_more_set` and
every other devices body were explicitly excluded before emission.

## Typed ABI, callers, and PC layout

The fixed public contracts are:

```c
real device_group_get_value(short group_index);
void device_touched(long device_index, long unit_index);
boolean device_new(long device_index);
```

On the 32-bit target ABI, `short` is signed 16-bit, `long` and `real` are
32-bit, and `boolean` returns in AL. Each body consumes ordinary stack formals
and returns with plain cdecl `ret`; no hidden or register-carried parameter is
present. These C identifiers naturally decorate to the exact leading-
underscore COFF names.

The complete target use census is one `REL32` caller of the getter from
`hs.obj:_code_000aef20` at caller `+0x24`, one `REL32` caller of touched from
`players.obj:_code_000ab440` at `+0x47`, and one `DIR32` address-taken
reference to new from the `object_types.obj` function table at `.data+0x704`.
Reconstructed source has the corresponding HS evaluator, players call, and
object-type callback. `players.c` already declares touched as
`void(long,long)`, and `object_types.c` already declares new as
`boolean(long)`. No shared-header edit is required.

The target getter begins by sign-extending its 16-bit stack formal (`MOVSX`),
proving the parameter is `short`, not the donor-like unsigned form formerly
declared in `hs.c`. Its source-local typed group prefix is exactly eight bytes:
`short identifier` at `+0`, `word flags` at `+2`, and `real actual_value` at
`+4`; both total size and `actual_value` offset are compile-time asserted.
It passes the signed index to the declared `datum_get` contract and returns
the typed `real` field. Its exact relocations are `DIR32 +0x09` to
`_device_groups_data` and `REL32 +0x10` to `_datum_get`.

The retained constructor uses the current complete PC `device_datum` and
named fields. Its checked `device_get` call uses `_object_mask_device`; the
typed composite places `definition_index` at `+0`, object flags at `+4`,
power-group index at `+0x1A8`, and position-group index at `+0x1B4`.
January's order is preserved: call `device_definition_get` for the required
`tag_get` side effect, clear position group then power group to `NONE`, OR
named `_object_shadowless_bit` (bit 18) into the object flags, and return
`TRUE`. The exact relocation schedule is `REL32 +0x0E` to
`_object_get_and_verify_type` and `REL32 +0x1D` to `_tag_get`.

The rejected touched body was likewise public ordinary cdecl. January obtains
the checked device at `+0x0E`, dispatches target object type 8 to
`_control_touched` at `+0x27`, and target type 7 to `_machine_bumped` at
`+0x37`. The typed natural C preserved that semantic boundary but did not
reproduce January's instruction schedule, so no part of it was retained.

## Signed HS declaration correction and controlled A/B

Before candidate emission, the sole reconstructed declaration mismatch was
preselected for ABI correctness: the source-local prototype in `hs.c` changed
only from `unsigned short device_group_index` to
`short device_group_index`. The evaluator call expression, runtime body, and
all storage remain untouched. This was not a body-support repair or candidate
retry.

The pristine canonical `hs.obj` was 123,259 bytes with SHA-256
`a9b3359853a5f5dc54202b55f580c24ac8dfdbb4668a1d5d839fc72758c58126`.
The corrected-declaration `hs.obj` is 123,257 bytes with phase-specific
SHA-256
`386b16365f04e185966b7eff120bca1aa2135d51ff9619edcb569baa78d445d3`.
A controlled complete runtime fingerprint A/B evaluated all 448 functions and
all 38 runtime non-code sections: no function or runtime section vanished,
appeared, or changed. Both sides have identical runtime fingerprint SHA-256
`265ee09d45a354caf662925a79dab7433b323ef0df5838c5e27bb40bbff8971d`.
The only object delta is `.debug$S|anonymous=0`, reflecting corrected prototype
type metadata. Thus every non-owner consumer is runtime-identical while the
source contract now agrees with the target callee's signed load.

## Preserved exact inventory and ownership boundary

Direct hardened January comparison proves the complete final nine-body
inventory:

| Exact function | Meaningful / padded | Relocations | Normalized SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `_devices_dispose` | `1 / 16` | 0 | `499f1f307c1cb989f968a6b7fcaec591e1828877223d0b0e7e8e8b76cde8c9ca` |
| `_devices_dispose_from_old_map` | `13 / 16` | 2 | `9dedd614496101c84c04e338b0fb2167843b37380b3f0e2a50007ce9c2bc7edc` |
| `_device_set_never_appears_locked` | `64 / 64` | 1 | `e180e3b5196b04ad2c72967cdc93bdc207a23cc33b12d406864567ff38d55e36` |
| `_device_one_sided_set` | `59 / 64` | 1 | `37b297855afc1da1f38223444572043ab773a86d1831a3c828a24175f687bfb6` |
| `_device_set_actual_position` | `53 / 64` | 2 | `d0e53196194b9cab6dd3e748e0b9c4d81902b02b465dfd019ed632d338c9d836` |
| `_device_set_desired_position` | `57 / 64` | 2 | `46aed102030b8a7a6ca51498138ebba7ce8952c3f05d2b9ea73affce0ade5b4f` |

| `_device_group_get_value` | `28 / 32` | 2 | `14d2c7728226358605c598e4f2a5a78223c4ed901c5c313792e88985254fd65c` |

| **Final strict total** | **`411 / 480`** | **14** | |

The final object defines exactly these nine external code COMDATs. It defines
no runtime `.rdata`, writable `.data`, `.bss`, or COMMON owner. The group data,
object/tag accessors, and inherited helpers remain undefined value-zero
dependencies. All 208 target non-code bytes remain unclaimed; compiler and
target literals receive zero standalone data credit.

The retained implementation is readable typed defined C. It contains no
assembly, raw address or byte-offset dereference, pointer/integer
reconstruction, cast overlay, pointer or union pun, inactive-union access,
undefined signed overflow, data-dependent representation trick,
private/register ABI, volatile scheduling device, optimizer pragma or barrier,
synthetic anchor, or byte-forcing expression.

## One-shot discipline and pre-commit validation

The local typed record, includes, signed declaration correction, and all three
fixed bodies were frozen before emission. Exactly one VC7 `/Zs` parse-only
check passed without creating an object. Exactly one natural three-body
`devices.obj` candidate compile followed. Getter and new were strict in that
immutable object. Touched missed and was removed wholesale. The subsequent
production build only reproved the unchanged retained pair.

Only `source/devices/devices.c`, the declaration-only `source/hs/hs.c`
correction, and this new Jonas-owned ledger are tracked changes. No shared
header, configuration, storage owner, semantic exception, parked record,
completion label, pre-existing Markdown, or tracked deletion is changed. The
five protected sources remain untouched: `source/units/vehicles.c`,
`source/ai/ai_debug.c`, `source/ai/ai_script.c`, `source/ai/actions.c`, and
`source/units/units.c`.

- Complete `halobetacache_build` plus `libcmt_build`: pass. The controlled
  `hs.obj` build was followed by all 568 remaining production graph edges;
  only inherited repository warnings were emitted.
- Direct hardened final comparison: all nine emitted devices functions are
  strict, including padded bytes and every relocation identity, order, type,
  address, and addend.
- Semantic audit: 470 units, 4,158 functions evaluated, 3,571 missing-base
  symbols, 4,018 semantic exact, 101 hidden exact / 61,876 hidden code bytes,
  36 ordinary-only, 35 structurally accepted, one rejected, 12 locals skipped,
  4,079 accepted exact, and zero unit errors.
- Campaign progress: 375/833 objects, 4,066/11,060 exact functions,
  482,927/2,198,102 meaningful code bytes, and 1,835,088/4,176,062 matched
  data bytes.
- Halo progress: 273/468 objects, 3,899/7,574 functions,
  470,013/1,770,166 code bytes, and 1,829,896/3,923,451 data bytes. Libcmt
  remains 102/212 objects, 167/476 functions, 12,914/55,015 code bytes, and
  5,192/8,637 data bytes.
- `devices.obj`: 9/30 exact functions and 411/4,463 meaningful code bytes;
  it remains nonmatching and claims no data.
- Object admission: zero candidates and zero revocations; only the inherited
  unrelated `source/shell/shell_xbox` completion-label contradiction remains.
- Parked validation: three active entries, zero stale, zero invalid.
- Complete tooling suite: 179/179 tests pass. `git diff --check`, changed-path,
  deleted-path, protected-five, source-policy, and storage checks are clean.

The clean committed-state replay is recorded additively after the

## Clean committed-state replay

Implementation-and-ledger commit
`fe7be487044937a2fb51a9c1d2e8f4cef2cd23a6` was clean before replay and is
authored and committed by Jonas Volman. Re-reading that commit proves devices
source blob `b20ab75aa491468b606583165c727cabd8f4c2a6` and HS source blob
`ed38056c21a03ca9c8402f330ba24d551132bd9c`; the shared devices header remains
baseline blob `638221fd4dfd7ff7196b528798845ce0d194d997`.

A two-unit regression snapshot was captured from that exact clean commit at
`build/regression_devices_group_get_new_20260821.json`, with status
`SNAPSHOT_WRITTEN` and units `source/devices/devices` and `source/hs/hs`.
The first invocation's default Ninja token was denied by the host before any
mutation; the successful snapshot used the same authenticated external Ninja
1.13 executable that drove the earlier full build. This changed no source,
configuration, object, or acceptance evidence.

Both generated paths resolved inside the isolated-worktree root:

- `C:\Users\isabe\Documents\Codex\2026-07-13\i-w\devices-group-touch-new-20260821\build\base\source\devices\devices.obj`
  was 2,709 bytes with SHA-256
  `b7c27295feda16d2b50a609c6b24aedc56717ef8a92b51d49c00c3bc0346fa0b`.
- `C:\Users\isabe\Documents\Codex\2026-07-13\i-w\devices-group-touch-new-20260821\build\base\source\hs\hs.obj`
  was 123,257 bytes with SHA-256
  `386b16365f04e185966b7eff120bca1aa2135d51ff9619edcb569baa78d445d3`.

Each resolved path was explicitly proved beneath the worktree root. Exactly
those two files were deleted, and a second existence check proved both absent.
The untouched production Ninja graph then rebuilt them through exactly two
normal actions: `[1/2] CL build\base\source\devices\devices.obj` and
`[2/2] CL build\base\source\hs\hs.obj`. There was no source change, body
retry, alternate compile edge, or candidate tuning.

The immediate no-build regression check returned `ok: true`, no failures, no
warnings, `changed_nonexact: []`, and `newly_exact: []` for both units.
Devices' `still_exact` set is exactly the nine functions in the inventory
table above; all 442 previously accepted HS functions also remain in its
`still_exact` set. A subsequent Ninja dry run reports `ninja: no work to do.`

Direct hardened January comparison after rebuilding returns
`all_equal: true` for all nine devices bodies. It independently reproduces the
97 newly retained meaningful bytes, all 112 padded bytes, all four new
relocations, and both normalized SHA-256 values. The replay `devices.obj` is
2,709 bytes with phase-specific whole-file SHA-256
`f72e5bb3176c551ffcd337cf683b1267acf012b3ee5ffa9a8c39b447a7c78db7`.

The replay `hs.obj` is 123,257 bytes with phase-specific SHA-256
`f7d353145b385120f205966c39ee44fcf57f57d3e3260cab147fb021ea4b2f8f`.
Repeating the controlled semantic A/B against the pristine object again finds
448 functions on each side with no vanished, appeared, or changed runtime
function, and 38 runtime non-code sections on each side with no delta. The
sole complete-object difference remains `.debug$S|anonymous=0` prototype type
metadata.

An independent post-rebuild COFF ownership census again finds exactly the
nine defined external code COMDATs in the table and no runtime non-code
section. Its undefined external inventory is exactly `__fltused`,
`_data_make_invalid`, `_datum_get`, `_device_group_set_actual_value`,
`_device_group_set_desired_value`, `_device_groups_data`,
`_object_get_and_verify_type`, `_object_try_and_get_and_verify_type`, and
`_tag_get`. The final tracked delta after replay is this additive ledger
section only. Nothing is pushed, amended, or history-rewritten.
