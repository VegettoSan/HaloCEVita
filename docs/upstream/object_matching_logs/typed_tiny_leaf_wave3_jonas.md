# Typed tiny leaf wave 3 — Jonas checkpoint

This checkpoint records eleven independently strict-exact leaf functions
recovered on 2026-08-20 from authoritative campaign commit
`2f7fbec5720fe4fa04c9bee6cb6e4a04477db53a`.  The seven owning objects remain
`NonMatching`; this is partial-function evidence only.

## Signature and layout proof

All twelve audited candidates had complete return and parameter types before
the first source compile.  The HCEA Release PDB DIA type records report:

- `short heap_left_index(short)`;
- `short heap_right_index(short)`;
- `float hud_globals_get_scale(unsigned char)`;
- `void input_abstraction_reset_controller_detection_timer()`;
- `unsigned char cache_files_precache_in_progress()`;
- `unsigned short playlist_profile_number_of_default_profiles_on_disk()`;
- `unsigned short saved_game_file_get_type(long)`;
- `unsigned char transport_network_available()`;
- `void game_set_players_are_double_speed(unsigned char)`;
- `unsigned char game_players_are_double_speed()`;
- `void game_difficulty_level_set(short)`;
- `short game_difficulty_level_get()`.

The HCEA Debug PDB independently corroborates the HUD, cache, saved-game, and
four game signatures.  Repository declarations and target-local callers
provide independent type evidence for the game, saved-game, HUD, playlist,
input, and transport candidates.  January disassembly and relocations prove
the retained field offsets and leaf operations.  HCEA type records additionally
prove the game runtime prefix: `players_are_double_speed` is at `0x2`, the
embedded options begin at `0x8`, and difficulty is at runtime offset `0xE`.

## Strict retained results

`tools/coff_compare.py` reports exact padded size, normalized bytes,
relocation count, relocation type, destination identity, and addend for every
retained function.

| **Total** | **11 functions** | **121 / 208** | **9** | |

The retained code increases the semantic exact ledger by eleven functions.
No owning object is marked complete.

## Corrective runtime-data ownership audit

A follow-up audit from authoritative integration commit
`0a58d015f2dc58d1d9c3fc85d3618af2d8b4396f` withdraws all four BSS claims
made by the original typed-leaf commit. Byte equality and matching synthetic
csplit owner names do not authenticate the complete natural C types needed to
define these objects:

| Object | Former owner | Withdrawn bytes | Why the definition is unauthenticated |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `game.obj` | `_bss_0043e48c` | 4 | HCEA authenticates the accessed pointee prefix and offsets, but not a complete natural owner declaration for the synthetic pointer symbol. |
| `input_abstraction.obj` | `_input_abstraction_globals` | 224 | The former type was a `0xD0` byte prefix, one field, and `0xC` bytes of inferred trailing reserve. |
| `playlist_profile.obj` | `_bss_004d2858` | 116 | The former type was a `0x6C` byte prefix plus inferred fields and padding. |
| `cache_files_windows.obj` | `_bss_004cdff8` | 12,412 | The former type used a `0x3048` opaque byte prefix and inferred trailing fields solely to force the target section size. |
| **Total** | | **12,756** | |

The complete-size assertions, inferred trailing fields, and all four storage
definitions are removed. Minimal typed prefix views retain only the independently
proven accessed offsets: game double-speed at `0x2`, game difficulty at `0xE`,
the input timer at `0xD0`, playlist count at `0x70`, and cache copy flag at
`0x3048`. Each owning symbol is now an undefined external with COFF section
zero and external storage class; none of the four candidate objects emits a
non-debug runtime-data section.

This deliberately changes exact data from 12,756 bytes to zero while retaining
all seven affected leaf functions:

| Object | Exact code before | Exact code after | Exact data before | Exact data after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `game.obj` | 55 meaningful / 96 padded, 4 functions | same | 4 | 0 |
| `input_abstraction.obj` | 11 meaningful / 16 padded, 1 function | same | 224 | 0 |
| `playlist_profile.obj` | 7 meaningful / 16 padded, 1 function | same | 116 | 0 |
| `cache_files_windows.obj` | 6 meaningful / 16 padded, 1 function | same | 12,412 | 0 |
| **Total** | **79 meaningful / 144 padded, 7 functions** | **same** | **12,756** | **0** |

`hud_globals_get_scale` has one reviewed representation-only ownership detail.
January's csplit object represents `__real@3f800000` as an undefined external
symbol.  The candidate emits the same four bytes under the canonical external
`.rdata` COMDAT with selection `2` (select-any), and its function relocation
names exactly that symbol at the same address and type.  The COMDAT is
candidate-only and receives no data credit.  All January-owned non-code spans
remain unchanged.

## Rejected candidate

`transport_network_available` had a fully proven signature and compiled in the
bounded wave, but it was not retained.  Target and candidate both measured 16
padded bytes with one REL32 relocation to
`_XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus@0`; their normalized hashes were respectively
`73954fa0da7600bd1a60ddb3387eafabb788779227be715ec886a2fb1bdfe783`
and `eef4bf49c6b243bcaae881c7f8494b0d0f6d9e65505d6dbe7d8138d1f2b12b2b`.
The emitted mismatch was removed without source-shape tuning or retry.

## Source and policy audit

- Every retained function definition is ordinary readable typed C with an explicit
  final return.
- No inferred ABI, assembly, volatile scheduling device, optimizer pragma or
  barrier, force-inline annotation, synthetic anchor, type-pun, raw
  dereference, undefined behavior, or byte-forcing construct is present.
- No configuration, semantic exception, parked-function record, frozen large
  object, or Markdown outside this Jonas-owned ledger is changed.
- `vehicles.obj`, `ai_debug.obj`, `ai_script.obj`, `actions.obj`, and
  `units.obj` were kept source- and configuration-identical.  Their clean
  authoritative/current regression comparison reports no function, runtime
  data, relocation, or meaningful ownership change; only absolute-worktree
  `.debug$S` path records differ.

## Validation

- Full `halobetacache_build`, `libcmt_build`, semantic-report, and progress
  graphs pass with zero semantic unit errors.
- Semantic audit after correction: 470 units, 3,943 functions evaluated,
  3,803 semantic exact, 3,864 accepted exact, and zero unit errors.
- Progress before/after correction: code remains 467,867/2,198,102 bytes and
  3,851/11,060 functions; data moves from 1,847,564 to 1,834,808 of 4,176,062
  bytes, exactly `-12,756`.
- The authoritative pre-correction regression manifest reports only the
  intentional BSS removals, debug/section-index changes, and symbol definitions
  becoming undefined. It reports `changed_nonexact: []`. Direct hardened
  comparison proves all seven affected functions retain the padded sizes,
  relocation identities, and hashes in the strict-results table above.
- Admission audit: zero candidates and zero revocations; only the inherited
  `source/shell/shell_xbox` contradiction remains.
- Parked audit: three active, zero stale, and zero invalid entries.
- Tool suite: 179/179 tests pass.

A clean post-correction commit regression snapshot/check is required and
recorded in the final handoff. No GitHub push is performed.
