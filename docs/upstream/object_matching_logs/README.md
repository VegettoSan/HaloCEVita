# Object exact-match strategy logs

For the completed/interrupted Opus 2 and new Fable 5 lanes, start with the
[current reconciliation queue](../reconciliation_queue_20260907.md). It separates
published progress, donor claims, dirty work, owner holds and tooling defects.

Every object that receives implementation or matching work must maintain one
Markdown ledger in this directory. The filename is the object name with
`_obj.md`, for example `players_obj.md`.

General techniques that apply across translation units belong in
`docs/exact_match_acceleration_playbook.md`; object-specific measurements stay
in the individual ledger.

Start constant and diagnostic recovery with the
[common constants reference](../common_constants.md) and
[shared assertion API](../assertions.md), before testing guessed literals.

The purpose is to make matching work cumulative. A new lane must be able to
distinguish an untried evidence-backed source shape from a spelling that has
already compiled to the same bytes.

## Required contents

Each ledger must include:

1. **Scope and provenance**
   - source translation unit and target object;
   - exact compiler identity and flags;
   - target-build provenance used for names, layouts, or source topology.
2. **Validated baseline**
   - exact/total function count and padded code bytes;
   - exact/total data sections and bytes;
   - for every residual: target/base size, relocation count, normalized hash,
     and first meaningful divergence.
3. **Accepted controls**
   - the source shapes retained in production;
   - why each shape is supported by binary or provenance evidence.
4. **Experiment matrix**
   - every meaningful source shape tested;
   - resulting size, relocations, normalized hash, first divergence, and
     sibling-regression result;
   - whether it was retained or reverted.
5. **Do-not-repeat list**
   - equivalent spellings or compiler-control attempts already exhausted;
   - unsafe or prohibited techniques.
6. **Residual classification**
   - source/topology, ABI/register, scheduling, ownership/relocation, data, or
     unresolved;
   - clearly separate measured fact from inference.
7. **Reopen criteria**
   - the exact new evidence that would justify spending another lane.
8. **Disposition**
   - strict exact and eligible for `Matching`, still active, or rigorously
     parked;
   - never grant credit from a fuzzy percentage, equal size alone, or semantic
     plausibility.

## Lane rules

- Update the ledger after every bounded experiment batch, not only at handoff.
- Rebuild with XDK 3911 and the repository flags after each retained change.
- Gate every function and owned data section with the hardened comparator.
- Run the whole-translation-unit regression sweep before committing.
- Revert failed source shapes immediately.
- Treat exact bytes as necessary but not sufficient: reject semantically
  nonsensical, historically implausible, logically meaningless, or inert
  compiler-steering source, even when it happens to match. Coincidental byte
  equality never authenticates the source. Park the best honest fuzzy
  reconstruction when a natural exact spelling is not available.
- Do not use inline assembly outside a sparse, provenance-backed helper/math
  exception. Never use volatile byte forcing, undefined behavior, object-byte
  patches, or compiler-flag changes.
- A parked residual must preserve enough evidence for another agent to
  reproduce the classification without redoing the full search.
- Label a defect `BUG (original)` only when January binary/source evidence
  proves the defective behavior belongs to the original game. A mistake or
  omission in our reconstruction is not an original bug. Preserve proven
  original behavior in the matching build and document the corrected-build
  alternative in a comment without changing the matching token/line shape.
- When retroactively documenting an old lane, state which experiment details
  were not preserved. Never manufacture source variants, hashes, or outcomes
  to make a historical matrix look complete.
