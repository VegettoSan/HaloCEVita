# `actors.obj` Jonas reset-leaf first shot

## Result

This bounded source-only wave starts from clean cumulative commit
`c3f20ecb6074dd143ec413be6d50b22672390968`. The anonymous actor-update
sentinel reset matches in the first and only production candidate compile.
`source/ai/actors.obj` advances from 23/76 to 24/76 strict functions and from
1,448/19,130 to 1,459/19,130 meaningful code bytes. Its target-owned data
advances from 0/2,288 to 4/2,288 bytes. The object remains `NonMatching`.

| New retained item | Meaningful | Padded | Relocations | Normalized SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `_code_0002a150` | 11 | 16 | 1 | `b9bd364577858b88535fa3f98c80f483828f2f1dacaee4666d0752ed07fecadf` |
| `_global_updating_actor_index` | 4 data bytes | 4 data bytes | 0 | raw payload `ff ff ff ff` |

The new function and all 23 inherited accepted functions pass the hardened
COFF comparator. Together they account for 1,459 meaningful / 1,648 padded
code bytes and 92 relocations. The function's only relocation is an i386
`DIR32` at `+0x02`, with zero addend, to the new external data owner.

## January object, ABI, and compiler evidence

- January executable: 6,584,672 bytes, SHA-256
  `4cc87b45f721270392a96f1674ed2b5cd4a7bb4355faeab4531d1cf1884d9520`.
- January split `source/ai/actors.obj`: 56,916 bytes, SHA-256
  `632a2b344e779e5d58e4d9e8e881700d8d106d51fdc3b74cc731aff9e7c3d9b9`.
- Compiler `xbox/bin/vc7/CL.Exe`: 81,920 bytes, SHA-256
  `483e00c47bb08d699475a642bcff15b5b2036350b31c540e88a506baf101da11`.
  The natural build uses the unchanged `/O2 /Oy- /DDEBUG /Dxbox` contract.

January defines `_code_0002a150` as an external function symbol, storage class
2 and type `0x20`, in one ordinary selection-1 `.text` COMDAT. Its complete
bytes are:

```text
c7 05 00 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff c3 90 90 90 90 90
```

The four zero bytes at `+0x02` are the relocation slot for
`_global_updating_actor_index`. The section contains 11 meaningful bytes,
five terminal NOPs, one relocation, and the normalized hash in the result
table.

January defines `_global_updating_actor_index` as external storage class 2,
type 0, at offset zero in the sole four-byte `.data` section. That section has
raw payload `ff ff ff ff`, zero relocations, and characteristics `0xC0300040`:
initialized data, four-byte alignment, readable, and writable. The first-shot
object reproduces the payload, owner, storage class, type, offset, relocation
count, and section characteristics exactly. Object-local section numbers
differ naturally: January uses function/data sections 34/137, while the
partial rebuilt object uses 32/3.

January's adjacent `_code_0002a120`, `_actor_delete`, and
`_code_0002d290` also reference this sentinel. The reset leaf has no caller in
the current split-object graph, and no other split object owns either new
symbol. The PDB address-name is therefore preserved without inventing a
semantic public name or header declaration.

## Retained typed source

The pre-wave `source/ai/actors.c` blob is
`e08b43bafa362cc567101cfef4fe6a62ff21a0b1`. The frozen retained blob is
`598cbbad64526c85329bd759deaa9c7b20e2f151`. Its worktree form is 17,836
CRLF bytes with 693 CRLF endings, zero bare-LF endings, and SHA-256
`543d51391995ff12e5b613dd413479c4e51a0a95b6c2f9c1a3b21b1350be1bf5`.

The complete retained source packet is:

```c
long global_updating_actor_index = NONE;

void code_0002a150(
	void)
{
	global_updating_actor_index = NONE;

	return;
}
```

The global follows the existing actor data-array globals. The function follows
`actor_change_encounter`, which preserves January's relative source order
around the missing anonymous `0x2A120` and `0x2A160` bodies. Neither symbol is
`static`; no prototype or `actors.h` edit is introduced. The ordinary typed
assignment naturally emits January's external owner, four-byte initialized
storage, instruction form, padding, and relocation.

## Claude documentation and tooling audit

All available Claude documentation relevant to this object, prototype/ABI
inference, compiler matching, knowledge-base boundaries, snapshot discipline,
and verification tooling was reviewed before the source freeze. The direct
Claude documentation repository is at clean production commit
`0e1fc785b7f5fb8c8d6fec8cae667005aa663957`; its only dirty tracked file is
the reviewed research cache `tools/equivalence/leaf_cache.json`. No dirty
production source was consumed.

The associated machine-readable/tooling evidence was also reviewed:

- `tools/audit/check_arg_counts.py`: SHA-256
  `3e5842ca9b8f7c16142a0b35fa4417a49405d51ff422ce879ea38dea22c8ef32`;

  `cda268fbb8fda91b71d3dbe83a7c08b2aeafeb68a3ba3ac3dc83f205e0bedfcc`.

Two actor-specific Claude commits supply semantic corroboration only:

- `c16cf9d1008d4e963783d85be95b22578aaff479`, actor source blob
  `0cc3402d9393a5bfeedf0fa1500520afe616d3c3`, documents a later-build actor
  activation routine setting raw `DAT_002c8728` to the active actor handle and
  restoring `0xFFFFFFFF` on every normal and early exit. It explicitly infers
  the datum as the currently activating actor.
- `ea6fbc266952a4423a8b009db5abed822c96913c`, actor source blob
  `74daeec154cabcc9e28b23c547b1bbc800daca79`, documents the later-build actor
  deletion assertion that its actor handle differs from the current updating
  actor.

Those commits authenticate the sentinel's activation/reset and deletion-guard
meaning. Their raw addresses, later-build layouts, compiler, and anonymous
function bodies were not transplanted. January's PDB, split object, current
typed declarations, and pinned XDK remain authoritative.

Current campaign method documents were pinned as well:

- `docs/matching_methodology.md`: SHA-256
  `3eb52f6b2df7b94b4d732161c0f86e2becebbcf0b546824deb957882118b1b5c`;
- `docs/exact_match_acceleration_playbook.md`: SHA-256
  `daea76d57fa4e9bf746d4d284d05843fdfcc458f95836d7f05a72fb8d0fa136c`;
- `docs/shape_transfer_executor_strategy.md`: SHA-256
  `072ee7b2b3a2900e401bec7f69bff475f57639456d9c6270d2ea51189aaefa83`.

The reviewed policies require binary-first ABI proof, readable C89-compatible
source, strict relocation identity, fail-closed snapshots, and no knowledge-
base or configuration mutation to manufacture matching credit. This wave
follows those boundaries.

## Independent corroboration and no-attempt census

The clean cross-build bridge at
`bf520b6938d256ecc9a55d93e994a9f5dd389ec1` classifies
`_code_0002a150` as `january_only`, reason `anonymous-symbol`, January size 11,
and `implemented_nonexact=false`. Its correspondence JSON has SHA-256
`c6ea66d530438fba92d27790001c631d973d41e7fb6bacb21a4525763ec6cfbc`.
The clean HCEA repository at
`570c83fd9c365dad6f2a3e7041705d5b84c7847c` contains no direct symbol or
standalone analogue; that absence is treated as a boundary, not filled by a
guessed donor.

The ignored 431,129-byte January shape atlas has SHA-256
`99d1bf539a05a6d9af923f2808f4a4b8f158b3375e5780860822753fa06d2380`.
Five current exact donors independently prove the identical VC7 code shape:
`_damage_initialize_for_new_map`, `_draw_string_dispose_from_old_map`,
`_player_ui_end_editing_profile`, `_code_000d0800`, and
`_reset_last_player1_profile_index`. Each is an ordinary no-argument void
assignment of `NONE` to a four-byte external-storage lvalue at offset zero,
followed by a terminal return. The atlas is scheduling evidence only; it grants
no matching credit.

An all-ref `-S`/`-G` history search, actor-ledger census, split-object owner
search, and registered-worktree census found no previous definition or
production attempt for either retained symbol. The baseline object contains
neither symbol. An independent read-only audit repeated the target, Claude,
cross-build, HCEA, atlas, and no-attempt checks and returned GO before source
mutation.

## Frozen one-shot discipline

The isolated worktree was created at the exact cumulative base. During
untouched setup, an initial regression snapshot using the default Ninja path
failed before validation, and the explicit-Ninja retry exposed stale copied
Ninja timestamps by beginning an unrelated baseline graph. It stopped at a
network-denied tool download. This happened before source mutation and emitted
no candidate code. After `ninja -t restat`, `all_source` reported no work and
the tracked tree remained clean.

The untouched isolated `actors.obj` was then produced once for a stable local
baseline: 8,307 bytes, SHA-256
`46eb47b90aabddb28241c79088a84c56683db25e8ce60f575e2e1346f4eed2a0`.
All 23 inherited functions passed direct strict comparison. The final clean
pre-wave regression manifest is 1,344,843 bytes, SHA-256
`9c346865d465606245ae1172609bcac9fd1a97c2abd3f2b771fe276506377c38`,
and records base commit `c3f20ecb`.

After the two source additions were frozen, `git diff --check` passed. The
exact production-flag XDK `/Zs` parse-only invocation succeeded and left the
baseline object byte-identical. The resolved live object path was proved
inside the isolated worktree, the literal generated artifact was removed,
absence was verified, and the dry run showed exactly:

```text
[1/1] CL build\base\source\ai\actors.obj
```

That normal edge was invoked once. The immutable first-shot object is 8,671
bytes, SHA-256
`6dc70ce36d9dcbe293fd5db5103f9c67fc72e9cc4ed55a0609da3469f6eb9840`.
There was no declaration, spelling, control-flow, storage, source-shape, flag,
or compiler-tuning retry.

## Strict function, data, and regression boundary

The hardened comparator reports `all_equal: true` for `_code_0002a150` and
all 23 inherited functions:

`_actors_initialize`, `_actors_dispose`, `_actors_initialize_for_new_map`,
`_actors_dispose_from_old_map`, `_actor_is_noncombat`, `_actor_in_combat`,
`_actor_is_fighting`, `_actor_is_leaping`, `_actor_get_weapon`,
`_actor_has_ranged_weapon`, `_actor_target_unit_index`,
`_actor_derive_target_information`, `_actor_flush_position_indices`,
`_actor_has_unlimited_grenades`, `_actor_change_encounter`,
`_actor_unit_control_crouch`, `_actor_unit_control_jump`,
`_actor_unit_control_primary_trigger`, `_actor_unit_control_secondary_trigger`,
`_actor_unit_control_throw_grenade`, `_actor_unit_control_exact_facing`,
`_actor_unit_control_stop_animation_impulse`, and `_actor_delete_props`.

The generic pre-wave regression check reports exactly `_code_0002a150` under
`newly_exact` and `changed_nonexact: []`. It deliberately fails closed on the
23 inherited accepted fingerprints, non-code sections, debug records, and
symbol inventory because inserting a new early `.data` owner and `.text`
COMDAT renumbers object-local sections. No adjudication or waiver is added.

Direct acceptance-view fingerprinting removes only numeric section identifiers
and proves every inherited runtime non-code section unchanged: the existing
`.bss` owner and all seven `.rdata` owners have no vanished or changed entry.
The sole appeared runtime section is
`.data|owners=_global_updating_actor_index`. Direct external-symbol census has
no removal and adds exactly:

- `_code_0002a150`, value 0, type `0x20`, storage 2, `.text`;
- `_global_updating_actor_index`, value 0, type 0, storage 2, `.data`.

The target and candidate `.data` sections both contain exactly four `FF` bytes,
have zero relocations, and use characteristics `0xC0300040`. This closes the
intended function, relocation, data-owner, inherited-code, and inherited-data
boundary without relaxing the generic gate.

## Full validation and campaign progress

The complete Halo and libcmt object graphs pass and then report no work.
Canonical outputs are:

- `build/report.json`: 1,574,813 bytes, SHA-256
  `390e72f604cbc59a1b7eda692b631ca138df82ce9b7a5877b7b8b63e0c659db0`;
- `build/semantic_report.json`: 2,985,700 bytes, SHA-256
  `6620895737aa7d207c1a03de53a05ab682b1c307051e098efc3f78de98d58985`.

Campaign progress becomes:

- all categories: 375/833 complete objects, 4,158/11,060 exact functions,
  502,621/2,198,102 meaningful code bytes, and
  1,835,212/4,176,062 data bytes;
- Halo: 273/468 complete objects, 3,991/7,574 exact functions,
  489,707/1,770,166 meaningful code bytes, and
  1,830,020/3,923,451 data bytes;
- libcmt remains 102/212 objects, 167/476 functions, 12,914/55,015 code
  bytes, and 5,192/8,637 data bytes.

The strict semantic audit scans 470 units and evaluates 4,265 functions:
4,123 semantic exact, 114 hidden exact / 64,705 hidden code bytes, 36
ordinary-only, 35 structural, one rejected, 12 local skips, 3,464 missing,
4,184 accepted exact, and zero unit errors.

Admission remains zero candidates and zero revocations, with only the
inherited unrelated `source/shell/shell_xbox` completion-label contradiction.
Its 384-byte JSON has SHA-256
`f0aa45c22cc604fb74abc388b06dd79a27e7a0b498a5d28837a9e785680c9a36`.
Parks remain three active, zero stale, and zero invalid; the 3,950-byte JSON
has SHA-256
`cfac03aea5be607c19a6a40bcdbc1164e71ffb0179602af4bd37b3fd50e26d1d`.
All 179 tooling tests pass, and all 14 tracked/configuration/canonical-report
JSON documents parse. `all_source`, `halobetacache_build`, and `libcmt_build`
dry runs report no pending work.

## Scope and policy

The tracked implementation scope is exactly `source/ai/actors.c`; this new
Jonas-owned ledger is the only documentation addition. No header,
configuration, semantic exception, parked record, completion label,
pre-existing Markdown, Claude-owned file, or build rule changes. There are no
deletions.

The complete `source/units/**` tree and all protected paths have zero
intersection with the wave: `source/units/units.c`, `source/units/units.h`,
`source/game/game_engine.c`, `source/game/game_engine.h`,
`source/units/vehicles.c`, `source/ai/ai_debug.c`, `source/ai/ai_script.c`, and
`source/ai/actions.c` are untouched.

The retained source is readable typed C89-style code. It contains no assembly,
raw address or byte-offset access, pointer/integer reconstruction, pointer or
union pun, inactive-union access, undefined signed overflow, volatile or
`register` scheduling device, force-inline annotation, optimizer pragma or
barrier, synthetic anchor, object-byte forcing, or compiler-control change.
No push, amend, rebase, history rewrite, or worktree removal is performed.

## Clean committed-state replay

The implementation-and-ledger commit is
`ff5313485ec116714bb2ae7cf594072de992ff47`, authored and committed by Jonas
Volman. It retains source blob `598cbbad64526c85329bd759deaa9c7b20e2f151`
and first-shot ledger blob `e99d32015e9ec979f1c7cf2f55d22a164d1a84d8`.
The tracked worktree was clean before replay.

A clean accepted-state regression snapshot was captured at that exact commit.
The manifest is 1,351,284 bytes, SHA-256
`2782efd9ded5077a097b2666c5f613aa13434455c7b54c49d05a161385649f86`.
Its immediate check has no failures or warnings, empty `newly_exact` and
`changed_nonexact` arrays, and all 24 strict functions under `still_exact`.

The live first-shot object was preserved again as
`pre-committed-replay.obj`: 8,671 bytes, SHA-256
`6dc70ce36d9dcbe293fd5db5103f9c67fc72e9cc4ed55a0609da3469f6eb9840`.
The resolved production path was proved inside the isolated worktree, the
literal generated file was removed, absence was verified, and the selected-
object dry run named exactly one CL edge. The unchanged committed source then
rebuilt once through that ordinary edge. This was a reproducibility replay,
not a candidate or tuning pass.

The 8,671-byte committed replay object has phase-specific whole-file SHA-256
`44993b4e1ef3c8d04b53cc96840e1c86cc17d0db1df0144006e789e667001401`.
The raw hash differs because VC7 writes compile-time/debug metadata into the
COFF container. Runtime evidence reproduces exactly: the hardened comparator
passes all 24 functions; `_code_0002a150` retains its 16 padded bytes,
normalized hash, and sole `DIR32` relocation; and the external data owner
retains type 0, storage 2, flags `0xC0300040`, four `FF` bytes, and zero
relocations.

The accepted-state manifest check after rebuild again has no failures or
warnings, empty `newly_exact` and `changed_nonexact` arrays, and all 24 strict
functions under `still_exact`. Canonical report and semantic-report sizes,
hashes, progress counts, and semantic counts reproduce the first-shot values.
Admission reproduces zero candidates / zero revocations plus the inherited
unrelated `shell_xbox` contradiction. Parks reproduce three active / zero
stale / zero invalid. All 179 tooling tests and all 14 selected JSON parses
pass again. The complete Halo-plus-libcmt graph and `all_source` dry run report
no pending compile work, and the tracked worktree is otherwise clean before
this additive replay record.

## Cumulative-HEAD closure

The authoritative `jonas/units-integration-20260824` branch was cleanly
fast-forwarded from `c3f20ecb6074dd143ec413be6d50b22672390968` through the
implementation and isolated replay commits to
`4bfb4dbda7ef58cb8a285ee9b50a96f85d26d6c1`. The committed source blob,
function/data scope, and protected-path exclusion are unchanged.

Before cumulative replay, the cumulative worktree retained its 8,307-byte
sentinel-free `actors.obj`, SHA-256
`a91cc3f6ecbf4398e1dd6d85a07791611202e2418bfe9d365223022a94f95fae`.
That artifact was preserved. Its resolved path was proved inside the
cumulative worktree, the literal live file was removed, absence was verified,
and the selected-object dry run named exactly one CL edge. The ordinary edge
then rebuilt the committed source once.

The cumulative replay object is 8,671 bytes with phase-specific SHA-256
`561637cc9a950e6f8952199ce336c5cb6b20b38b37133d7e871d0a4573aebfaf`.
Direct hardened comparison again proves all 24 accepted functions, including
the reset leaf's complete padded section and ordered relocation. The external
sentinel again reproduces value zero, type 0, storage 2, four-byte `.data`,
flags `0xC0300040`, raw `ff ff ff ff`, and zero relocations.

The cumulative clean manifest is 1,351,284 bytes, SHA-256
`ffad32f9f8bb2e33cb29b2b88a3d49d7f436abf63cb79b3e2d612367e1479e9a`.
Its immediate check is clean with all 24 functions under `still_exact` and
empty failure, warning, `newly_exact`, and `changed_nonexact` lists.

The cumulative canonical reports reproduce the isolated 1,574,813-byte
`build/report.json` hash
`390e72f604cbc59a1b7eda692b631ca138df82ce9b7a5877b7b8b63e0c659db0`
and 2,985,700-byte `build/semantic_report.json` hash
`6620895737aa7d207c1a03de53a05ab682b1c307051e098efc3f78de98d58985`.
Every campaign, object, function, relocation, data-owner, semantic, admission,
park, test, JSON, source-policy, protected-path, no-deletion, and no-pending-
work result above is reproduced at cumulative HEAD. No push, amend, rebase,
history rewrite, or worktree removal occurs.
