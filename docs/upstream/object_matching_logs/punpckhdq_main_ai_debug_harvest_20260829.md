# `punpckhdq/main` AI-debug harvest

This ledger records the admissible progress harvested from
`punpckhdq/halo` commit `fc47f9a15a0aea7f0081394c4d66db5c68ab5323`.
The authoritative integration base was
`6a1c13bb6010d567986af01bdc4749a1e86bf888`.

## Retained result

`source/ai/ai_debug.obj` advances from 11 to 23 strict-exact functions. The
12 newly exact functions total 1,600 padded code bytes. Equality here means
equal section size, normalized bytes, relocation count, relocation addresses,
and strict relocation destinations; no comparator exception is involved.

The donor was adapted rather than copied wholesale:

- The canonical `selected_squad_index` member name is preserved so the
  inherited exact `_ai_debug_highlight_cluster` keeps its relocation identity.
- The donor's missing 16 KiB debug-state span is represented locally in
  `ai_debug_state`. The shared `path_state` and `path_debug_storage` layouts are
  unchanged, preserving every non-debug AI consumer and its layout assertions.
- The existing early `ai_debug_state` field names and raw compatibility span
  remain in place for `actions`, `actor_looking`, `ai_communication`, and the
  scripting globals.
- Typed dialogue prototypes and the dialogue-definition declaration are added
  for the two speech functions. `unit_speak` is const-correct with the existing
  declaration in `ai_communication.c`.

## Audited but not retained

- `breakable_surface_effect`: the upstream 4,032-byte near match relies on an
  inline-assembly `fast_ftol`. An ordinary-C replacement retained all 11 sibling
  exact functions but left 2,526 normalized byte differences, so the entire
  candidate was removed.
- `collision_log_end_time`: the public function gates exact, but its required
  256-byte private user-selection helper cannot prove strict relocation
  identity because the split target aliases the common user-array address to a
  different data owner. The comparator fails closed, as intended, so the pair
  was removed.
- The donor's unsafe `real_point3d` cast in `ai_debug_render_actor`, raw-address
  comments, placeholder render bodies, and unrelated declaration changes were
  not imported.

## Policy and validation

The retained diff is ordinary readable typed C. Its added lines contain no
assembly, `volatile`, `register`, pragmas, attributes, intrinsics, raw
addresses, pointer-punning casts, byte forcing, or comparison exceptions.
No-argument prototypes use explicit `void`, parameters are one per line, C89
declarations precede statements, subsystem tag-block access stays typed, and
all retained functions have explicit terminal returns.

After integration, an exhaustive strict census compared every available
punpckhdq rebuilt object against both the January split target and the current
canonical rebuild. It covered 466 comparable objects and 7,534 target function
owners and found zero donor-exact function still absent from canonical. An
unfiltered section-owner pass found only the non-function `.text` owner in
`physics_variables.obj`; that unit's seven listed functions are already 7/7
strict-exact in canonical.

- Strict object gate: `23 exact / 2 residual / 35 unwritten` of 60 listed.
- Full Ninja graph: passes; 470 units scanned and zero unit errors.
- Semantic report: 4,806 functions evaluated, 4,682 semantic exact, 4,692
  accepted exact.
- Object admission: zero candidates, contradictions, and revocations.
- Park validation: 13 active, zero stale, zero invalid.
- Campaign attestation scan: passes; reported aliases belong only to existing
  residual functions and grant no match credit.
- Tool tests: 205 passed.
- `git diff --check` and added-line policy scan: clean.
