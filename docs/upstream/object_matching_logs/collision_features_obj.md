# collision_features.obj matching log

## Result

- Upstream provenance: `punpckhdq/halo` commit `1aa21fd12d56a6fe737cd0e9ab4516e31f3a3f47` (`collision_features (#48)`).
- Compiler: XDK 3911 CL 13.00.9254.1 with the repository flags `/O2 /Oy- /DDEBUG /Dxbox`.
- Strict result after adaptation to the current campaign trunk: 20/20 functions pass `tools/coff_compare.py` (`section_infos_equal`).
- Upstream whole-object report: 6,929/6,929 meaningful code bytes and 896/896 data bytes; `.text` and `.rdata` are both 100%.
- No assembly, volatile codegen coercion, `__forceinline`, byte patching, undefined-behavior trick, compiler-flag change, or comparator exception is used.

## Integration and type audit

The upstream implementation was compiled and measured in a pristine worktree before any transplant. All 20 functions passed the hardened comparator, including relocation destination identity. The full upstream report also proved the 896-byte `.rdata` ownership and content.

The current campaign already had partial collision-feature structures. The completed upstream layout was retained and guarded with compile-time size/offset checks:

- `collision_feature`: `0x0C`
- `collision_sphere`: `0x1C`
- `collision_cylinder`: `0x28`
- `collision_prism`: `0x68`
- `collision_feature_list.spheres`: `0x08`
- `collision_feature_list.cylinders`: `0x1C08`
- `collision_feature_list.prisms`: `0x4408`

The source follows the project formatting rules: one parameter per line, explicit returns, no raw `tag_get`/`object_get` casts, and no gratuitous alignment directives. Several boolean collision routines retain multiple returns because that is the January control-flow shape; forcing a single exit would change the object, so this is one of the house rule's documented exceptions.

## Current-trunk codegen interaction

The pristine upstream patch was exact, but its first current-trunk build left only `_collision_prism_test_vector` nonexact. Size and relocation identity were already exact (`0x290`, 11/11). Two independent instruction-order differences were isolated:

1. The `vn` dot product evaluated the `j` product before `k`; January evaluates `k`, then `j`, then `i`.
2. At the inlined `point_from_line3d` boundary, `fstp p3d.z` and `lea &p3d` were transposed.

The accepted readable controls are:

- keep the upstream no-parentheses `point_from_line3d` body (`v*t + p`), which restores the January inline-boundary scheduling;
- accumulate `vn` sequentially in January order (`k`, then `j`, then `i`), which preserves the observed x87 evaluation order.

Together these restore strict equality for all 20 functions.

## Rejected forms

- The unadapted donor body under the current shared header: exact size/relocations, but two instruction-order regions differed.
- Reversing the one-line dot-product terms alone: VC7 reassociated them back to `j`, `k`, `i`; no improvement.
- Sequential `k`/`j`/`i` accumulation while retaining the parenthesized inline helper: fixed the dot product but left the `fstp`/`lea` transposition.
- A named pointer holding the return of `point_from_line3d`: optimized to the same remaining transposition.
- Longhand first or second point-from-line expansion: either had no effect on the transposition or introduced repeated `fchs` operations and a six-byte regression.

## Admission gate

Before admission, regenerate the full report on the integration worktree, compare the strict accepted-function ledger against the pre-transplant baseline, and require zero lost entries. Any data or sibling-function regression rejects the object despite its own 20/20 result.

## House-rule compliance re-audit (2026-08-07)

The completed source and header were re-read against `docs/house_rules.md` and
Berthalamew's guidance.  Parameters are vertically formatted, typed structures
replace raw access casts, `void` functions end with explicit `return;`, and the
files contain no assembly, `volatile`, `__forceinline`, optimization pragma,
or gratuitous alignment directive.  CRLF is consistent.  The measured
multi-return collision predicates remain the documented exception: their
January control-flow graphs require those exits, and forcing a cosmetic single
exit would destroy strict equality.

## Current-campaign independent admission (2026-08-13)

The object was rebuilt from source on campaign commit `1bf72e84` with XDK
3911, not accepted from the donor's report alone.  A target-owner sweep found
**30/30 strict-exact sections**: all 20 functions and all 10 owned `.rdata`
sections.  This verifies padded bytes, relocation count/order/type/destination
and addend, string ownership, and storage class.  There is no target-owned
`.data` or `.bss` in this translation unit.

The shared `real_math.h` correction has a deliberately large possible blast
radius, so the ordinary one-object check was not considered sufficient.  A
clean baseline and the candidate were both fully rebuilt, then every
externally owned target section that was strict before the change was checked
again against January.  The result was **6,963/6,963 prior-exact sections
retained**, with **0 strict regressions** and **0 ownership/type/value drifts**
across 7,111 checked owner symbols.

The `project_point3d` change fixes a defect in our prior reconstruction, not a
bug in the shipped game.  The old helper returned the two integer axis indices
as coordinates; the January behavior indexes the input 3D point with those
axes.  In plain English, projecting `(x,y,z)` must select two coordinates from
that point, not return values such as `0` and `2`.  The corrected readable
expression also agrees with the recovered projection table and the January
callers.

Final campaign delta versus the clean baseline is exactly one completed Halo
object, 14 newly credited functions (six functions were already exact), 6,188
new exact code bytes, and 896 exact data bytes.  The complete build and
semantic/progress reports pass with zero unit errors.
