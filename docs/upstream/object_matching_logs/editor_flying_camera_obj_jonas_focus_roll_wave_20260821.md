# `editor_flying_camera.obj` Jonas focus/roll wave

## Result

This bounded source-only wave starts from exact canonical commit
`fd4cb20f52fd9df0b66d07c0dee225475a40c5e3`. Five authenticated natural
bodies were emitted together in the first and only code-producing candidate
compile. Three are independently strict and retained; the two misses were
removed immediately without a source-shape or code-generation retry.

`editor_flying_camera.obj` advances from 5/21 to 8/21 exact functions and
from 45/5,065 to 335/5,065 meaningful code bytes. It remains `NonMatching`.
The wave gains 290 meaningful and 304 padded code bytes, 29 relocations, and
no data credit.

| Retained function | Meaningful | Padded | Relocations | Normalized SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `_editor_camera_get_focus` | 122 | 128 | 13 | `fcbc16d17ca58ad82807d47a380e2a35b3557c6313a61587e109170e335a07e4` |
| `_editor_camera_set_focus` | 128 | 128 | 13 | `8b7fe295b0ab83638e0b9d4998ca0452f75d8b61233aed6023609e4b64e4068e` |
| `_editor_camera_use_roll` | 40 | 48 | 3 | `6cdf9034713ee5447c6ef31128d250ebaa736ef45c9b7551b22050a376081f76` |
| **Wave gain** | **290** | **304** | **29** | |

The hardened COFF comparator reports `all_equal: true` for all three retained
bodies. Their padded bytes and every relocation address, type, destination,
and addend are identical to January. The other 13 unmatched functions and all
520 target non-code bytes remain outside this wave's credit.

  using the repository's unchanged XDK 3911 command and flags.

The January PDB, assertion strings and line metadata, disassembly, and HCEA
donor fix the screened signatures as:

```c
void editor_camera_get_focus(
	real_point3d *position,
	real_euler_angles2d *angles);
void editor_camera_set_focus(
	real_point3d const *position,
	real_euler_angles2d const *angles);
void editor_camera_set_position(
	real_point3d const *point,
	real_euler_angles2d const *angles);
boolean editor_camera_use_roll(boolean new_use_roll);
void editor_camera_move_to_point(real_point3d const *point);
```

HCEA supplies readable natural bodies and independent layout evidence;
January remains authoritative for the PC assertions, `set_position` fallback
call, public vector helper, 2.5-real constant, symbol identity, extent,
padding, bytes, and relocation ownership.

## Typed layout and retained behavior

The prior source already exposed the scripted byte at `+0x00` and mode at
`+0x2C` through an external grouped-BSS prefix. This wave naturally refines
the intervening typed fields without defining storage: use-roll at `+0x01`,
initialized at `+0x02`, the 20-byte persistent focus at `+0x04..+0x17`, and
the editor flying-camera pointer at `+0x18`. The local camera type follows the
independently preserved HCEA layout: position, two-angle orientation, roll,
and field of view. This avoids a cast or overlapping-type view while naming
the exact January offsets.

`editor_camera_get_focus` and `editor_camera_set_focus` assert their two
pointers with January's source path and lines 120/121 and 129/130, then copy
the complete typed point and two-angle records. Each has eight assertion
relocations plus five `DIR32 _bss_0031d438` relocations to `+4`, `+8`,
`+0xC`, `+0x10`, and `+0x14`.

`editor_camera_use_roll` returns the prior byte, stores the requested byte,
and clears the camera's roll at `+0x14` when roll use is disabled and a camera
exists. Its relocations are `DIR32 _bss_0031d438+1` at code offsets `+9` and
`+0xF`, and `DIR32 _bss_0031d438+0x18` at `+0x17`.

The source defines no `.data`, `.bss`, or COMMON storage. The retained
assertions necessarily reference compiler-folded string literals, but this
incomplete wave does not authenticate or claim any of the target object's
520 non-code bytes.

## One-shot rejection record

| Rejected function | Target meaningful / padded / relocs | Target hash | First natural candidate |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `_editor_camera_set_position` | `146 / 160 / 11` | `b4b5dc5d6f88c8d32309b8019c9c1f00e7a9607fc097812f57bc7e412219e1a3` | 160 padded / 13 relocs, SHA `aa90ee75950f6b36f3e2ff1665940895b6d914ddb028d24f4b89ce76e97eca34`; the defined typed body reloads the external camera pointer around the member copies, unlike January's single retained pointer value. |
| `_editor_camera_move_to_point` | `120 / 128 / 10` | `a9a76937ef6744f3ed0a1dece0ad93e77619b3e70e22f23f0e8e2c9409396958` | 144 padded / 12 relocs, SHA `1a277bb6cc12186f5f91470cd900b3afb0a83f126d65f7acc8a1e11441296133`; repeated defined typed global member access does not reproduce January's post-helper pointer reuse. |

Both candidates had the authenticated semantics: `set_position` asserted its
arguments, called `editor_camera_set_focus` and set initialized when no camera
existed, otherwise copied the point and two-angle orientation; `move_to_point`
asserted its point, called public `vector3d_from_euler_angles2d`, and placed the
camera 2.5 units behind it. Their code-generation shapes were not exact. Both
definitions and symbols are absent from the retained COFF. They may be
reopened only with newly preserved January source or equivalent independent
ordinary-C topology evidence; this wave does not tune from the rejected
bytes.

## Policy, scope, and validation

Only `source/camera/editor_flying_camera.c` and this new Jonas-owned ledger
change. No header, storage definition, configuration, semantic exception,
parked record, protected/frozen source, pre-existing Markdown, or Claude-owned
file is modified. The five inherited exact getters remain strict.

The retained implementation is readable typed C with house formatting and
explicit terminal returns. It contains no assembly, `volatile` scheduling
device, force-inline annotation, optimizer pragma/barrier, raw address or
byte-offset access, pointer/integer reconstruction, cast or pointer/union pun,
inactive-union access, undefined overflow, synthetic anchor, or object-byte
forcing.

- Complete 569-action `halobetacache_build` and `libcmt_build`: pass.
- Direct hardened comparison: all three retained functions pass; both
  rejected symbols are absent from the final COFF.
- Semantic audit: 470 units, 4,102 functions evaluated, 3,962 semantic exact,
  101 hidden exact / 61,876 hidden code bytes, 4,023 accepted exact, and zero
  unit errors.
- Campaign progress: 375/833 complete objects, 4,010/11,060 exact functions,
  478,890/2,198,102 meaningful code bytes, and
  1,835,088/4,176,062 matched data bytes. Halo contributes 3,843/7,574
  functions and 465,976/1,770,166 meaningful code bytes.
- Admission audit: zero candidates and zero revocations; only the inherited
  `source/shell/shell_xbox` completion-label contradiction remains.
- Parked validation: three active, zero stale, and zero invalid entries.
- Complete tooling suite: 179/179 tests pass; `git diff --check` is clean.

A clean committed-state snapshot/check followed by deletion and forced
same-path rebuilding of `editor_flying_camera.obj` is the final
reproducibility proof. The post-rebuild hardened comparison must retain all
three exact bodies with both rejected symbols absent. No push is performed.
