# `game_statistics.obj` exact-match strategy ledger

## Scope and toolchain

- Translation unit: `source/game/game_statistics.c`
- January target object: `source/game/game_statistics.obj`
- Clean starting point: `codex/campaign-integration` commit
  `7f947ee8f7bbd1472e1f1738db04b8d565821dbb`
- Resumed closeout checkpoint:
  `e49e6a654230a4d70ae1b44e12e7e60e2b064e07`
- Isolated worktree branch: `codex/game-statistics-finish`
- Compiler: XDK 3911 CL 13.00.9254.1 for 80x86
- `CL.Exe` SHA-256:
  `483e00c47bb08d699475a642bcff15b5b2036350b31c540e88a506baf101da11`
- Repository flags, unchanged:
  `/nologo /c /O2 /Oy- /DDEBUG /Dxbox`, followed by the generated repository
  include-path set
- Acceptance oracle: `tools/coff_compare.py`, including padded function bytes,
  relocation identity/type/address/target/addend, and owned data
- Regression oracle: `tools.regression_gate`, freezing exact functions and the
  complete translation-unit non-code/symbol-ownership shape

No experiment used inline assembly, `_emit`, volatile byte forcing, undefined
behavior, object-byte patching, comparator weakening, gratuitous alignment
pragmas, or compiler-flag changes.

## Canonical-base re-audit (2026-09-03)

The claimed complete object was re-audited from canonical base
`332a39a56a5d3c5410bcf6743446492006c3de66`.  The audit censused all 1,743
registered local worktrees (19 raw on-disk source hashes, including line-ending
variants), every commit touching `source/game/game_statistics.c`, the named
Claude/Opus/Fable campaign trees, and the surviving dedicated
`game-statistics-*` experiment trees.  Every substantive historical family was
then compiled against the same January target with
`tools/campaign/gate.py source/game/game_statistics --all`.

Only the Fable source at `79275995c` (later admitted by `3b81021d4`) closes all
four functions.  Its sole closing construct is the one-use block-local
`short *kills` alias already rejected below: replacing `kills[0]++` with the
direct typed member immediately restores the one target/candidate transpose at
`+0x1AE`.  The independently reconstructed HaloCEA Xbox implementation also
updates `killer->statistics.kills[...]` directly.  Marathon contains no
analogous Halo statistics routine.  No original-source, PDB-local, or natural
same-compiler evidence supports the alias, so the exact donor remains rejected
under the anti-fake-match rule.

The admitted source-quality reconciliation makes no instruction change:

- `game_team_is_enemy` is declared only by its owner,
  `source/game/game_allegiance.h`, instead of being redeclared in this `.c`;
- the third public parameter is correctly named `killing_object_index` in both
  the definition and the closest associated owner header, `source/game/game.h`;
- `game_statistics_start` uses the semantic `TRUE` constant; and
- the direct typed `statistics.kills[0]` access remains intact.

Strict before/after state is therefore deliberately unchanged: **3 exact / 1
residual / 0 unwritten**, or **176 / 848 accepted padded code bytes**.  The
remaining function is 672/672 bytes with 22/22 relocation identities; target
SHA-256 is
`faed51b584f65f1a0f97f4416a0f599800dceeb2352a80dcf565d92d37724a69`,
candidate SHA-256 is
`c83a7c0613ccce274d91ca76f8f2315496ee2b9eefa91862c84160ff35ce5c0b`,
and the only instruction difference is:

```text
target +0x1AE: inc [esi+0x98]; movsx ecx,[esi+0x96]
base   +0x1AE: movsx ecx,[esi+0x96]; inc [esi+0x98]
```

The 42 direct `game.h` consumers plus the protected `units.obj` sentinel were
force-compiled after the owner-header edit.  A stable-section comparison over
their 1,983 target functions preserved all 1,732 previously exact functions
with zero gains or regressions; `units.obj` remained 189/189.  The focused
Ninja build, `git diff --check`, and `python -m pytest tools/ -q` (261 passed)
also succeeded.  The existing instruction-scheduling park and `NonMatching`
classification remain correct.

## Policy correction and current disposition (2026-08-31)

The exact admission described in the historical section below is revoked under
the campaign's newer anti-fake-match rule.  Fable commit
`79275995c484a2637aa5db570030d42a9e02685d` found two byte-closing changes, but
only the loop-initialization order is retained.  The one-use block-local
`short *kills` alias is an optimizer carrier: its only effect is to obscure the
alias relationship between `kills[0]` and the adjacent `last_kill_time` field
so that VC7 preserves January's store/load schedule.  No Bungie source, HCEA
source, PDB local, or other authentic semantic evidence supports that local.

The canonical source therefore uses the direct typed member increment
`credited_player->statistics.kills[0]++`.  It gates at 3 exact / 1 residual;
`_game_statistics_record_kill` remains 672/672 bytes with 22/22 relocation
identities and base normalized SHA-256
`c83a7c0613ccce274d91ca76f8f2315496ee2b9eefa91862c84160ff35ce5c0b`.
The sole residual is the independent schedule at `+0x1AE`: January increments
`kills[0]` before loading `last_kill_time`, while VC7 hoists the load first.
Objdiff reports 99.04306% for the function and 99.211296% for the unit.

The unit is `NonMatching` and the residual is active in
`config/parked.json`.  The exact carrier result below remains only as negative
experimental history; it is not admissible match credit.

## Rejected exact candidate (historical, 2026-08-31)

The former register-allocation park documented below was temporarily
superseded.  Fable
commit `79275995c484a2637aa5db570030d42a9e02685d` supplied two ordinary source
corrections, and both were independently re-applied and revalidated at
canonical checkpoint `c71441a02e26a238bcc5e8643a8f903b2dfa63b7`:

1. Initialize `attacker_index` before taking the `attacker` pointer.  The donor
   experiment swept all 360 legal orders of the six loop-setup initializers;
   this one adjacent swap was the unique exact order.
2. Preserve the natural array decay of the typed `short kills[4]` member in a
   block-local `short *kills`, then increment `kills[0]`.  This keeps the
   credited-kill source order without an intrinsic barrier: XDK 3911 cannot
   prove that the pointer increment is disjoint from the adjacent
   `last_kill_time` field, so it does not hoist that load ahead of the kill
   increment.

The first change preserves the existing logic and is retained.  The second
uses a valid pointer type but is rejected because the local has no independent
semantic role: it is consumed once and exists only to steer alias analysis and
instruction scheduling.

`tools/campaign/gate.py source/game/game_statistics --all` reports all four
target functions exact.  A direct hardened `tools/coff_compare.py` invocation
over all four functions reports `all_equal: true`:

| Function | Meaningful / padded bytes | Relocations T/B | Normalized SHA-256 | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| `_game_statistics_start` | `8/16` | `1/1` | `4eb29bc953165a2d51bef0bb3528cd233ddf8a287aaf2beb597b6c4e135976ce` | strict exact |
| `_game_statistics_stop` | `132/144` | `6/6` | `8557a20c7974bd29c33d99a8cd1404b45e3a2211bd9d27c47f47c90502f64a5a` | strict exact |
| `_game_statistics_record_damage` | `1/16` | `0/0` | `499f1f307c1cb989f968a6b7fcaec591e1828877223d0b0e7e8e8b76cde8c9ca` | strict exact |
| `_game_statistics_record_kill` | `661/672` | `22/22` | `faed51b584f65f1a0f97f4416a0f599800dceeb2352a80dcf565d92d37724a69` | strict exact |

The owned `_game_statistics_active` BSS datum is also strict exact: `1/1`
byte, zero relocations, normalized SHA-256
`6e340b9cffb37a989ca544e6bb780a2c78901d3fb33738768511a30617afa01d`.
Baseline-versus-candidate whole-object fingerprints preserve all 30 symbol
records, every section owner, both exact sibling functions, `.drectve`, BSS,
both `.debug$F` sections, and both compiler-constant `.rdata` sections.  The
only `.debug$S` byte differences are the four decimal PID characters in the
gate's temporary object path (`_gate_39136.obj` versus `_gate_35768.obj`);
logical size, section inventory, and ownership are unchanged.

The source-level `NonMatching` comment and park entry were temporarily removed
for this candidate.  The policy correction above restores both classifications
after rejecting the carrier.

## Exhaustive provenance review

The January target and all surviving project history were inspected before
settling the source:

- every ref whose name contains `game-statistics`, every reflog exposed by the
  surviving worktrees, and every commit touching this translation unit;
- all ten surviving game-statistics worktrees, including dirty state;
- the preserved `target.txt` and `base.txt` disassemblies and relocation
  reports;
- the sole surviving untracked experiment object;
- all distinct historical source blobs: the stub `2a535...`, the initial
  reconstruction `018aa9...`, and the tightened reconstruction `e0f219...`;
- the relevant history families: `ef7e421`/`0281a653` for the leaves,
  `17fbdf8` for stop, `813605ee`/`34d9bc5` for the first kill
  reconstruction, and `eb84038`/`2f67d985` for the tightened kill topology.

The untracked historical object under
`lanes/game-statistics-kill/work/game_statistics.obj` has strict normalized
hash
`0176f61946f7067fcad75d879d97af2a279e14a5c767f54d2732808e6d4dd563`.
It preserves the same `0x2A0` padded size and all 22 relocation identities but
has additional later code-generation differences, so it is strictly
superseded by the campaign baseline.

Two external provenance checks were also exhausted:

- The May 2004 HEK Sapien implementation at `sapien.exe:0x658300` has the same
  logical reset order and the same credited-kill order: increment the kill
  counter, then read the prior last-kill time. Its compiler allocation differs
  (EDI is the shared zero and ESI holds `NONE`), so it is corroborating source
  topology rather than a byte donor.
- `artifacts/circular-pdb-extract.json/pdb_symbols.json` and the surviving PDB
  expose labels and globals but no local-variable or statement provenance for
  this function. No original Bungie C or exact January donor survived in the
  research tree.

## Initial measured baseline

At the clean starting commit, three of four functions were strict exact: 176
of 848 padded `.text` bytes. The sole owned target datum,
`_game_statistics_active`, was also strict exact.

| Function / datum | Padded size T/B | Relocs T/B | Target normalized SHA-256 | Initial base normalized SHA-256 | Initial result |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| `_game_statistics_start` | `0x10/0x10` | `1/1` | `4eb29bc953165a2d51bef0bb3528cd233ddf8a287aaf2beb597b6c4e135976ce` | same | strict exact |
| `_game_statistics_stop` | `0x90/0x90` | `6/6` | `8557a20c7974bd29c33d99a8cd1404b45e3a2211bd9d27c47f47c90502f64a5a` | same | strict exact |
| `_game_statistics_record_damage` | `0x10/0x10` | `0/0` | `499f1f307c1cb989f968a6b7fcaec591e1828877223d0b0e7e8e8b76cde8c9ca` | same | strict exact |
| `_game_statistics_record_kill` | `0x2A0/0x2A0` | `22/22` | `faed51b584f65f1a0f97f4416a0f599800dceeb2352a80dcf565d92d37724a69` | `ee9e334b928000272d26bfd08725d09579bb7e258685b0074a5608c54fa704f0` | two residual windows, first at `+0x67` |
| `_game_statistics_active` | `0x1/0x1` | `0/0` | `6e340b9cffb37a989ca544e6bb780a2c78901d3fb33738768511a30617afa01d` | same | strict exact |

All 22 kill-function relocation identities, types, addresses, symbolic
targets, and addends already agreed. The initial normalized residual was:

```text
+0x67:
target:    xor esi,esi; ... mov [eax+0x92],si; ... mov [eax+0x94],si
baseline:  xor edx,edx; ... mov [eax+0x92],dx; ... mov [eax+0x94],dx

+0x1AE:
target:    inc [esi+0x98]; movsx ecx,[esi+0x96]
baseline:  movsx ecx,[esi+0x96]; inc [esi+0x98]
```

Both windows reconverged immediately. The frame remained `0x28`, and every
branch, relocation, and instruction outside those windows agreed.

## Historical barrier checkpoint (superseded)

At this historical checkpoint, a Microsoft compiler intrinsic barrier
immediately after `credited_player->statistics.kills[0]++` was retained.  It
emitted no machine instruction and prevented XDK 3911 from moving the
independent last-kill-time load ahead of the January kill-count store.  Current
house rules forbid compiler barriers, so this source is no longer retained.
The experiment restored the entire `+0x1AE` window:

```text
target/current +0x1AE:
66 ff 86 98 00 00 00    inc word ptr [esi+0x98]
0f bf 8e 96 00 00 00    movsx ecx,word ptr [esi+0x96]
```

The historical barrier-checkpoint state was:

| Function / datum | Padded size T/B | Relocs T/B | Base normalized SHA-256 | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| `_game_statistics_start` | `0x10/0x10` | `1/1` | `4eb29bc953165a2d51bef0bb3528cd233ddf8a287aaf2beb597b6c4e135976ce` | strict exact |
| `_game_statistics_stop` | `0x90/0x90` | `6/6` | `8557a20c7974bd29c33d99a8cd1404b45e3a2211bd9d27c47f47c90502f64a5a` | strict exact |
| `_game_statistics_record_damage` | `0x10/0x10` | `0/0` | `499f1f307c1cb989f968a6b7fcaec591e1828877223d0b0e7e8e8b76cde8c9ca` | strict exact |
| `_game_statistics_record_kill` | `0x2A0/0x2A0` | `22/22` | `726db672a9d0b8eba834f038f71f84584c3ef76a7279e538064ae020f898b94c` | non-exact; only three encoding bytes differ |
| `_game_statistics_active` | `0x1/0x1` | `0/0` | `6e340b9cffb37a989ca544e6bb780a2c78901d3fb33738768511a30617afa01d` | strict exact |

The complete final normalized residual is:

```text
+0x67 target/current:
33 f6 / 33 d2                   xor esi,esi / xor edx,edx

+0x6E target/current ModRM:
b0 / 90                        mov [eax+0x92],si / mov [eax+0x92],dx

+0x7E target/current ModRM:
b0 / 90                        mov [eax+0x94],si / mov [eax+0x94],dx
```

Thus the residual is exactly three register-encoding bytes. Size, frame,
control flow, all 22 relocations, and every other normalized byte agree.
Objdiff reports 99.904305% for the function and 99.92113% for the unit, but
those percentages are navigation aids and do not grant match credit.

## Historical experiment controls (superseded)

- `best_attacker_index` remains a `short`.
- The explicit attacker-pointer initialization, independent loop-index zero,
  saved `attackers` pointer, comparison operand order, and direct indexed
  attacker-field loads are retained because they are the strongest measured
  topology.
- The no-code `_ReadWriteBarrier` was retained only at this historical
  checkpoint because it restored the independently corroborated January
  credited-kill schedule without changing size or relocations.  It is rejected
  by the current house rules.
- The three exact function siblings and `_game_statistics_active` are frozen
  controls. Every experiment compiled the complete translation unit and
  checked all of them.
- Candidate-only compiler COMDAT constants, `.debug$S`, `.drectve`, symbol
  ownership, and all other non-code shape are protected by the whole-TU
  regression manifest even though only `_game_statistics_active` is an owned
  target data match.

## Experiment matrix

All experiments used the exact XDK 3911 command line. Unless marked retained at
that historical checkpoint, each source change was reverted immediately after
measurement.  Current policy supersedes the historical retain decisions.
Every row preserved all three exact function siblings and
`_game_statistics_active`.

E22-E25 were a bounded continuation batch. Each row was rebuilt with XDK
3911, measured by the strict comparator across all four functions, and checked
against the same-path whole-TU regression manifest. All four exact siblings
remained exact, `_game_statistics_active` and all frozen non-code/ownership
evidence remained unchanged, and the gate returned `ok: true` without warnings.

E26-E29 were a second bounded continuation batch with the same strict
comparator and whole-TU gates. All four shapes produced the exact R hash and
preserved every frozen sibling, datum, section, and ownership invariant.

E30-E31 were a third bounded continuation batch with the same gates. Both
barriers emitted no instruction and preserved size and all 22 relocations, but
each introduced a new scheduling difference while leaving the three EDX/ESI
bytes unresolved. The exact siblings and complete TU regression manifest still
passed.

E32-E35 were a fourth bounded continuation batch with the same gates. A true
cross-region attacker-index lifetime damaged the allocation topology, while
three disjoint source lifetimes disappeared before register allocation and
produced R exactly. No sibling, datum, or TU invariant regressed.

E36-E39 were a fifth bounded continuation batch with the same gates. Legal
typed field aliases and storage/const qualifiers were all erased or ignored
before allocation and produced R exactly. No sibling, datum, or TU invariant
regressed.

E40-E43 were a sixth bounded continuation batch with the same gates. Sentinel
predicate operand order canonicalized away; reversing the suicide operands
survived as the wrong `cmp` encoding but did not change the zero-register tie.
No sibling, datum, or TU invariant regressed.

E44-E46 were a seventh bounded continuation batch with the same gates. Even
when the zero was source-defined on both suicide-branch edges, XDK folded the
constant/phi before register allocation and produced R exactly. No sibling,
datum, or TU invariant regressed.

## Do-not-repeat list

- Do not return to `long best_attacker_index`, an address-taken selected
  attacker, eager `attackers` assignment, or the older loop family; the
  preserved historical object proves that topology is worse.
- Do not retry typed zero locals, reset-value forwarding, register hints,
  declaration-order swaps, saved event-index zeros, or defined null-derived
  zeros; XDK 3911 emits B or R unchanged.
- Do not retry compound self-zeroing of a preserved dead-player index (`&= 0`,
  self-XOR, self-subtraction, or multiplication by `FALSE`); XDK 3911
  constant-folds every form to R without preserving ESI affinity.
- Do not retry C89-style split initialization or wider source scopes for
  `dead_player_index`, `dead_player`, or `dead_team_index`; both isolated and
  combined shapes canonicalize byte-for-byte to R.
- Do not add barriers after the first or final reset store. They leave EDX in
  place and move the already-exact `killing_player_index == NONE` comparison.
- Do not carry the reset zero into the attacker loop through `attacker_index`;
  it changes allocation from the prologue onward. Reusing a separately
  overwritten attacker or friendly-fire variable has no effect and returns R.
- Do not retry typed pointers to the reset fields or `register`/`const`
  qualifiers on the dead-player index; all four variants produce R exactly.
- Preserve `killing_player_index == dead_player_index` operand order. Reversing
  it adds an independent compare-encoding mismatch, while reversing either
  sentinel comparison has no code-generation effect.
- Do not retry branch-edge or conditional-expression construction of the
  reset zero; identical constants and legal self-subtraction zeros are folded
  before allocation and produce R.
- Do not retry branch-local increment duplication or an explicit
  last-kill-time snapshot; neither affects the scheduler.
- Do not retry ternary/inverted multiple-kill logic, friendly-fire rewrites,
  chained reset assignment, or barriers in the reset window; each changes
  branches, relocations, or store order without resolving the allocator tie.
- Do not perturb exact siblings, target data, translation-unit headers,
  ownership metadata, or build flags to influence three ModRM/register bytes.
- The prohibited forcing techniques listed in the scope remain out of bounds.

## Residual classification

The Fable attacker-loop initialization-order correction naturally resolves the
former `+0x67` register-allocation window.  In the current direct-member source,
the sole residual is methodology class D: an independent instruction-scheduling
transpose at `+0x1AE`.  A compiler barrier closes it but violates current policy;
the one-use pointer alias closes it by hiding field disjointness but has no
independent semantic provenance.  Natural scalar, subobject-pointer, local-copy,
branch, expression, and declaration-order forms are covered by the experiment
matrix and either reproduce this fixed point or perturb already exact code.

This is therefore a rigorous fuzzy park, not a match.

## Verification gates

- Hardened comparator, all four functions plus `_game_statistics_active`:
  three functions exact, datum exact, kill `0x2A0/22` versus `0x2A0/22`,
  normalized base hash `726db672...`, and no residual outside the three
  encoding bytes.
- Same-path clean regression snapshot:
  `build/game_statistics_regression_manifest.json`, based on
  `7f947ee8f7bbd1472e1f1738db04b8d565821dbb`.
- Whole-TU regression check: `ok: true`, no failures or warnings; exact
  siblings are `still_exact`, `_game_statistics_record_kill` is correctly
  reported as `changed_nonexact`, and all frozen non-code/ownership evidence
  is unchanged.
- After E22-E46, the retained source was restored and rebuilt from the resumed
  checkpoint shape. The final comparator again reported kill hash
  `726db672...`, size `0x2A0`, 22 relocations, and only the three documented
  register-encoding bytes; the whole-TU gate again returned `ok: true` with no
  failures or warnings.
- A cross-worktree manifest was deliberately rejected because XDK embeds the
  absolute object output path in `.debug$S`. It was not waived; the clean
  baseline was regenerated in the same isolated path, after which the strict
  check passed.
- Consolidated default Ninja build: success. Csplit, objdiff report, semantic
  report, and progress completed; `unit_errors: 0`, and the progress verifier
  accepted all seven parked compiler ties.

## Reopen criteria

Reopen only for one of:

1. original Bungie C or January local-variable/statement provenance for
   `game_statistics_record_kill`;
2. an exact XDK 3911 donor containing the same dead-statistic reset live-range
   context; or
3. a newly demonstrated defined-C dependency/lifetime control not represented
   by E01-E46.

## Historical disposition and matching safety

`_game_statistics_record_kill` remains `NonMatching` and is recorded in
`config/parked.json` as a register-allocation fixed point.

Safe to mark `Matching` under the former candidate: **no**.

The equal size, relocation parity, three-byte residual, and semantic
equivalence are strong evidence for a compiler tie, but they are not
byte-for-byte identity and therefore are not match credit.

The two-change candidate documented above is byte-for-byte exact but is not
source-admissible under the current anti-fake-match rule.  The direct-member
source, current park entry, and `NonMatching` unit classification are the
canonical disposition.
