# `source/cseries/sort.obj` — MATCHING

**Status: byte-exact. All four functions, whole object.**
**Lane:** `claude/libcmt-stream` · **Object status in `config/config.json`:** `Matching`

**Toolchain:** XDK 3911 `CL.Exe` 13.00.9254.1 · **Flags:** the game set, `/O2 /Oy- /DDEBUG /Dxbox`
**Start state:** the source was a pure skeleton — symbol-map header and empty
section comments, no code.

| symbol | target | ours | exact |
|---|--:|--:|:--:|
| `_code_00080360` (2-byte selection sort) | 96 B / 0 rel | 96 B / 0 rel | **yes** |
| `_code_000803c0` (4-byte selection sort) | 80 B / 0 rel | 80 B / 0 rel | **yes** |
| `_qsort_2byte` | 336 B / 1 rel | 336 B / 1 rel | **yes** |
| `_qsort_4byte` | 320 B / 1 rel | 320 B / 1 rel | **yes** |

`section_infos_equal` passes for all four; `.text` sections are identical with
relocation fields masked. Normalized SHA-256: `21df9a493f4dd024`,
`c98ad64dbdb87dbc`, `c09f5aead7542561`, `1cedc780c4faa025`.

## 1. What the object is

An iterative quicksort specialised for 2-byte and 4-byte elements, with an
explicit 30-deep bounds stack and a selection-sort cutoff at 8 elements. The two
`_code_*` symbols are the selection sorts; they take `hi` in **EAX** under VC7's
custom calling convention for statics with fully-known call sites.

The comparator takes **values**, not pointers: the selection sort does
`xor eax,eax; mov ax,[ebx]` before pushing, i.e. zero-extension — so the 2-byte
element type is `word` (unsigned short), not `short`. `texture_page.c`, itself an
exact object, declares the callee as `boolean (*)(short, short)`; that prototype
disagrees with this definition but is ABI-compatible (both push 4 bytes), and the
zero-extension in the target is decisive for what `sort.c` itself uses.

`compare(a, b)` returns true when `a` sorts **after** `b` — proven by the
selection sort using it to find the maximum and swap it to the high end.

## 2. Source-shape findings

Five corrections were needed; each was read directly off the disassembly.

1. **Swap order.** The target loads *both* elements, then stores to `*best`
   first: `dx=*hi; cx=*best; *best=dx; *hi=cx`. That is
   `temp = *best; *best = *hi; *hi = temp;` — the mirror of the natural
   `temp = *hi; *hi = *best; *best = temp;`. This alone made both selection
   sorts exact.
2. **Unsigned comparisons throughout.** The target uses `jb` for the
   `element_count < 2` guard, `ja` for the cutoff test, and `shr` (not `sar`) for
   the midpoint. So `element_count` and the running `size` are **unsigned long**.
3. **`lo+1 < j`, not `lo < j-1`.** The target computes `lea eax,[esi+2]` and
   compares against `j`; writing the algebraically identical `lo < j-1` produces
   `lea eax,[edi-2]` with the operands reversed.
4. **The larger-partition test is a byte-basis comparison.** The target computes
   raw byte differences with no shift and no mask:

   ```
   e0  mov eax, edi     ; j
   e2  sub eax, esi     ; j - lo, in BYTES
   e4  mov edx, ecx     ; hi
   e6  dec eax
   e7  sub edx, ebx     ; hi - i, in BYTES
   e9  cmp eax, edx
   eb  jl  <right-larger>
   ```

   Written on `word *` pointers, any element-count form makes MSVC either emit
   two `sar`s or cancel them and mask (`and eax,0xfffffffe`) — 16 bytes too many.
   Only an explicit byte-basis comparison reproduces the plain `dec`:

   ```c
   if ((char *)j-(char *)lo-1>=(char *)hi-(char *)i)
   ```

   Note `j-1-lo >= hi-i`, `j-lo > hi-i` and the above are all integer-identical;
   only the third matches the emitted code.
5. **`depth = 0` is assigned before `hi`.** The target stores `[ebp+0xc]` (which
   the optimiser reuses for `depth` once the `element_count` parameter is dead)
   at 0x1f and `hi` at 0x26. Ordering the source the other way emits the two
   stores swapped. This was the last 3 instructions.

## 3. Notes

* `dword` is not a `cseries.h` type; the 4-byte variant uses `long`.
* Both `qsort` bodies are identical modulo element type, and both went exact from
  the same five fixes — a useful confirmation that the shapes are right rather
  than coincidental.
* The bounds stacks are `lo_stack[30]` / `hi_stack[30]`, fixed by the frame size
  (`sub esp,0xf4` = 4 + 120 + 120) and the `[ebp+eax*4-0x7c]` / `[ebp+eax*4-0xf4]`
  addressing.

### Comparator ABI boundary (2026-09-12)

A runtime finding from Stian Eklund's non-byte-matching NTSC decomp identified
renderer corruption when its `profile_sort32_compare_proc` was declared as
returning `int` rather than a byte-sized Boolean.  That finding is consistent
with the January evidence here: the custom `qsort_2byte` and `qsort_4byte`
callbacks return the project `boolean` type (`typedef byte boolean`), and all
four functions in this object are strict exact with that ABI.  Do not widen
either custom-sort callback to `int`; a callee that only defines `AL` cannot be
safely consumed as though it defined all of `EAX`.

This rule does **not** apply to `compare_profile_sections` in `profile.c`.
That function is passed to the C runtime `qsort`, whose comparator contract is
`int (*)(const void *, const void *)`, and it correctly remains `int`.  The
custom value-comparator ABI and the CRT pointer-comparator ABI are separate
boundaries.  Current January gates also keep `profile_enter_private` and
`profile_exit_private` strict exact, so downstream renderer differences must
not be "repaired" by changing either proven interface.

Two user-supplied analyses of Xbox debug build 2276 provide independent
cross-build corroboration: `profile_sort_decompilations.md` (SHA-256
`28cfc10694a9b6437d91f32c9dad3e7d4a3389c533c26643f9e48cc6560ce732`)
and `profile_sort_corruption_analysis.md` (SHA-256
`ada613e65c8992fed8b165d5529e2c65076c51511d7da2a3358f831c1add9a51`).
Its 16-bit selection sort tests `AL` immediately
after the indirect comparator call at `0x91d22`; its 32-bit selection sort does
the same at `0x91d7c`; and both quicksort comparator sites test `AL` at
`0x91f86` and `0x91fa3`.  The reported structure-surface comparator also
defines only the byte result.  Declaring that callback as returning `int`
therefore makes a rebuilt caller test stale upper `EAX` bits, which can retain
the timestamp written by nearby profiling code and corrupt the surface order.
This explains the observed renderer symptom, but it does not move January's
custom sorts out of their target-proven `sort.obj` owner or change the CRT
comparator above.  Treat the 2276 addresses and source ownership as cross-build
evidence; the January split object and exact gates remain authoritative.

## 4. Current-integration revalidation (2026-08-13)

The completed source was recovered from Claude's local `claude/libcmt-stream`
campaign commit `bf44b00d3e97f5781068b85d35d86f6d8751226e`, then cherry-picked onto the
current authoritative integration base `66af3489`. This was an audit and
admission lane, not a fresh reconstruction: reusing the already-proven work
avoided repeating the source-shape search above.

This checkout successfully rebuilt the object through Ninja with XDK 3911
`CL.Exe` 13.00.9254.1 and the configured `/O2 /Oy- /DDEBUG /Dxbox` flags. The
hardened comparator then reproduced the complete hashes and relocation evidence:

| symbol | padded bytes | relocations | normalized SHA-256 | strict result |
|---|---:|---:|---|:---:|
| `_code_00080360` | 96 / 96 | 0 / 0 | `21df9a493f4dd0244dfd9e3bdf4c1cfc68b33b8fa11f2e6bc8e30a76102b9205` | exact |
| `_code_000803c0` | 80 / 80 | 0 / 0 | `c98ad64dbdb87dbc89d00c9ff63b6ae4b1ec6685291add335aac30724f7032d4` | exact |
| `_qsort_2byte` | 336 / 336 | 1 / 1 | `c09f5aead7542561d64a5e7b41b4ba79c23bfbdf1cd45ed8c713fafa99dab200` | exact |
| `_qsort_4byte` | 320 / 320 | 1 / 1 | `1cedc780c4faa02599391876115607221a735e6d1cd51f7bcecb98eeca37dd3c` | exact |

Both quicksort relocations match in address, type, destination symbol, and
addend. The January object owns only these four `.text` COMDAT sections; it has
no `.data`, `.bss`, or `.rdata` to reconstruct. The candidate's `.drectve` and
`.debug$S` sections are the ordinary configured compiler artifacts and contain
no game-owned data.

The fail-closed TU regression gate reported all four symbols as `still_exact`,
with no changed non-exact functions, warnings, or failures. The full 466-object
`halobetacache_build` succeeded, ordinary and semantic progress generation
completed with zero unit errors, and all 173 tooling unit tests passed.

### House-rule audit

The implementation is readable C: no assembly, `volatile`, `__forceinline`,
undefined behavior, byte patching, special flags, or comparator exceptions are
used. Every parameter is on its own line, every function has an explicit final
`return;`, and the private helpers are correctly file-local. The two public
quicksort functions also retain their direct `element_count < 2` early return.
This is the narrow exception to the preferred single-return style: it is the
January-proven control-flow shape, and replacing it with an artificial shared
exit would change otherwise exact code. No tag/object access macros apply to
this generic cseries utility.
