# `bipeds.obj` semantic nine-function wave (2026-09-02)

## Result

This wave advances `source/units/bipeds.obj` from **16 exact / 0 residual /
35 unwritten** to **25 exact / 1 residual / 25 unwritten**. The nine strict
gains contribute **1,806 meaningful code bytes** and **1,872 padded target
bytes**:

The earlier `e02971dfd` candidate supplied a useful January-shaped starting
point. The retained version replaces its address-derived private labels with
the exact same-build Halo CE atlas names, replaces its byte-offset scenario
carrier with semantic TU-private scenario structures, uses the owner headers
for public prototypes, and restores the authentic collision height/radius
field names without changing the beta layout.

## Naming and ownership evidence

The exact same-build atlas at
`research/halo-symbol-atlas/symbols/halo_ce/4cc87b45f721270392a96f1674ed2b5cd4a7bb4355faeab4531d1cf1884d9520.jsonl`
maps the corresponding CE addresses to `biped_find_ground_surface`,
`biped_find_nearby_support_surface`, `biped_verify_object_vectors`, and
`biped_snap_facing`. COFF storage-class inspection then proves that the first
three January target symbols are static and `biped_snap_facing` is external.
The target also records both `debug_objects_biped_*_pills` toggles as undefined
externals in `bipeds.obj`; the TU-local declarations therefore do not invent
Biped or Objects BSS ownership.

The later HCEA implementations in `_research_cache/halocea/src/blam/units/`
independently corroborate the gameplay semantics and semantic structure/field
names. `unit_place` and `collision_surface_find_closest_point2d` now have typed
declarations in their owning headers. The redundant Biped declarations were
removed from `object_types.c`; `object_types.obj` remains 31/31 exact. The
existing Vehicle caller was updated with a type-only cast to the owner
prototype and remains 34 exact / 5 pre-existing residual.

During canonical reconciliation, the later Actor Moving header additions made
the otherwise-correct `unit_place` declaration expose a two-instruction C2
scheduling tie in `unit_preprocess_node_orientations`. Completing the same
owner-header cleanup fixed it naturally: `unit_preprocess_node_orientations`
is now declared beside `unit_place` in `units.h`, and its stale use-site
declaration was removed from `object_types.c`. This restores Units to 189/189
without changing the function body or adding any compiler-control construct.

The first combined canonical build also exposed a surplus
`point_from_line3d` COMDAT in `bipeds.obj`. January references the shared
helper but does not own it in this object. The two uses inside
`biped_find_ground_surface` now spell out the transparent coordinate
assignments with semantic local bindings. This preserves that function's
exact instruction schedule and all nine gains while removing the surplus
symbol; no pragma, forced-inline annotation, assembly, or fake dependency is
needed.

## Parked residual

`biped_find_nearby_support_surface` is retained as natural fuzzy C and parked.
Target and candidate are both 544 padded bytes with all 23 relocation
identities and 175 instructions. The only machine-code difference is the x87
evaluation order of two independent terms in the inlined
`plane3d_distance_to_point` dot product. The standard project helper is kept;
manually expanding and permuting its terms only to steer VC7 would be
unsupported matching scaffolding. The fail-closed classifier reports UNKNOWN,
so the park is unclassified and grants no exact credit.

## Validation

- focused gate: Bipeds `25/1/25`;
- protected owner: Units `189/189`;
- affected owners: Object Types `31/31`, Vehicles `34 exact / 5 inherited residual`;
- full build and semantic audit: nine accepted gains, zero accepted-function regressions;
- full code gain: `659,652 -> 661,458` meaningful bytes;
- `python -m pytest -q`: 255 passed;
- fake-match scan of the touched Biped/Players source: zero review leads;
- parked ledger: 89 active, zero stale, zero invalid;
- final candidate COFF: no `point_from_line3d` symbol or COMDAT;
- no inline assembly, forced inline/noinline, volatile steering, barriers,
  raw offsets, or address-derived identifiers are retained.
