/*
P2P.H

Internet play (p2p.c): machines that shared an invite reach each other's
system link games as if they were on one LAN. xnet.c routes the game's
traffic for them through here; sdl_platform.c passes invite links in and
out through the clipboard.

Addresses and ports are in network byte order.
