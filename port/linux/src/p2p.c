/*
P2P.C

Internet play: machines that shared an invite reach each other's system
link games as if they were on one LAN, without a server of this project's.

- An invite is a link, halo://join/<host><token>: the hash of the X25519
  public key the hosting machine makes each run (16 bytes of it, which no
  other key can be found to have; the first 6 are the machine's identifier,
  which its XNADDR also carries) and a random 16-byte token. A machine
  makes one when its game starts hosting (the game listens for
  connections), logs it, puts it on the clipboard, and offers it through
  Discord (p2p_discord.c). Nothing about a game is published anywhere else:
  without an invite there is no way to find or join it.
- Signalling (p2p_signal.c) goes through public MQTT brokers, on topics
  that are hashes of the token, with messages sealed with a key derived
  from it (p2p_crypto.c). A joiner offers its public key and the addresses
  it can be reached at; the host answers with its own, and makes the
  session once the joiner, answered, proves that it holds its key. The
  secret of their session comes from the two keys (X25519) and a nonce of
  each, and never travels.
- The tunnel is one UDP socket. Each machine learns its public address from
  public STUN servers, and both then send to each other's addresses until
  packets get through (hole punching). There is no relay: two machines whose
  NATs both map every destination to a new port cannot connect, unless a
  router forwards one of them a port. So a host asks its router to forward
  the tunnel's port (UPnP, posix_upnp.c) as soon as a player reaches out
  with its invite, and a joiner asks its own when it has not reached the
  host in a few seconds (network.allow_upnp); the forwarded port is one more
  of the addresses a machine offers (the joiner asks the host again every
  few seconds until they meet, and the host answers with them all). Every
  tunnel packet is sealed with a key of the session's for its direction,
  its header (the sender and the packet's number, the nonce) authenticated
  too, and a packet already received, or from further back than the last
  64, is dropped.
- Each peer gets a virtual address in 100.64.0.0/10, which the game sees
  (XNetXnAddrToInAddr maps the peer's XNADDR to it). The game's datagrams
  to a peer go onto the tunnel from xnet.c at once (p2p_send_datagram);
  otherwise xnet.c rewrites the game's destinations there to local
  stand-ins: a UDP socket here per peer and port forwards datagrams (the
  peer's to the game, and the game's from a socket connected to the
  peer), and a TCP listener per peer and port takes the game's connections,
  carried reliably over the tunnel by KCP (port/third_party/kcp). Traffic
  arriving from a peer leaves these stand-ins, and xnet.c reports it as
  coming from the peer's address. The
  game's broadcasts also go to every peer, so a host's game shows up in its
  joiners' system link lists, and joining works as on a LAN. A peer reaches
  only the game's own ports (xnet.c says which it has), and has a few
  stand-ins and connections at a time.

The work happens on a thread of its own, under p2p_lock (let go of for
whatever may wait: DNS, the desktop's link handlers); the game's threads
only look up and create stand-ins.
