/*
NETWORK_DISTRIBUTED.C

The distributed netcode's own messages (port/linux/NETCODE.md): the game's
"data" message kind (message header type 2, which the Xbox game never sent),
beside its packets, and handled here (network_*_message_handler.c).

The host decides; its clients predict their own players and show the
rest as the host has it:

- The game's objects (units, vehicles, weapons, equipment) are the host's,
  at the same datum index on every machine (network_objects.c): the host
  says which it has, where they are and what units carry.
- Every tick, a client sends the host its own players' input, each tick's
  buttons again with the next three ticks' (a press is lost only with four
  datagrams in a row), and the host takes each tick's buttons once. The
  host sends every client the other players' input as its tick ran it, the
  same way, and the clients drive those players with it
  (player_queues_new.c).
- Every tick, a client sends the host where its own players' units are (it
  predicts them from its own input); the host takes that as they are,
  within a tolerance, as later Halo engines do, at its next tick.
- Every tick, the host sends every client every player's unit: which unit
  the player has, alive or not, the seat it rides, its shields and health
  (down, recharging, the damage they show), and where it is (dead: who
  killed it, which a client announces when its copy dies). A client binds,
  kills, seats and places its copies to match (it decides no deaths or
  spawns itself), and its own only when far off (a respawn, a teleport).
  Players far from a client's own, or out of their sight, are sent to it
  (their units and their input) less often, but at once when they come into
  sight, and their input every tick while their buttons change.
- Twice a second, and with every kill, the host sends the players'
  statistics (kills, deaths, ...) that changed, and a few more round them
  all, which clients take as they are.
- Five times a second, the host sends the game type's state (the scores,
  the flags, the balls and the hill), which clients take as it is
  (game_engine_write_network_state).
- Damage is the host's: a client reports its own players' hits, which the
  host checks and deals, and replays the damage the host deals for its
  effects (network_damage.c).

The unreliable messages of a tick to a machine go in one datagram (a batch),
and each carries its tick (its header's game time): one that arrives after
a newer of its kind is dropped. Vectors travel in 16 bits a part.

Players are named by their absolute index, which is the same on every
machine (their datum identifiers need not be).
