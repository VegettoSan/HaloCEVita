/*
NETWORK_OBJECTS.C

The distributed netcode's objects (port/linux/NETCODE.md, stages 3 and 4).

The game's objects that matter to more than the eye (units, vehicles,
weapons and equipment) are the host's, and every machine has them at the
same datum index (identifier and all), so that any message can name one:

- The host tells its clients (reliably) of each object it makes, with what
  it is, where, and how it looks, and of each it deletes; a client makes
  and deletes its copies to match, at the host's index. A client that has
  loaded asks for the host's objects all over and is told when it has them
  all; from then on it deletes any such object it has that the host has not
  told it of (what its own simulation made: a dying unit's grenades, a
  vehicle's weapons), and nothing but the host's word deletes the host's.
- A client places the game's objects when its map loads as the host did,
  at the same indices: the host's word on those finds them already there.
  Past loading, its own objects (projectiles, effects' objects: what only
  it sees) take indices from the upper half of the array, which the host's
  do not reach in practice; a host's object that does comes first.
- Every tick the host sends where its moving objects are (vehicles, items,
  bodies), and a few of those at rest, round the lot; a client moves its
  copies there, a little off half of the way each tick, further drawn
  gliding from where they were rather than jumping (render_interpolation.c).
  A client's own player's vehicle is its own, as its own player's unit is:
  it sends the host where it drives it, which the host takes within a
  tolerance at its next tick, and puts it where the host has it only when
  far off.
- Ten times a second, the host sends what a unit carries when that has
  changed (and once a second whatever it is): which weapons, slot for slot,
  their ammunition, the weapon in hand and the grenades; a client moves its
  copies of those weapons in and out of its copies of the units to match (it
  decides no pickups, swaps or drops itself).
