/*
NETWORK_OBJECTS.C

The distributed netcode's objects (port/linux/NETCODE.md, stages 3 and 4).

The game's objects that matter to more than the eye (units, vehicles,
weapons and equipment) are the host's, and every machine has them at the
same datum index (identifier and all), so that any message can name one:

- The host tells its clients (reliably) of each object it makes, with what
  it is, where, and how it looks, and of each it deletes; a client makes
  and deletes its copies to match, at the host's index. A client that has
  loaded asks for the host's objects all over and is told when it has them
  all; from then on it deletes any such object it has that the host has not
  told it of (what its own simulation made: a dying unit's grenades, a
  vehicle's weapons), and nothing but the host's word deletes the host's.
- A client places the game's objects when its map loads as the host did,
  at the same indices: the host's word on those finds them already there.
  Past loading, its own objects (projectiles, effects' objects: what only
  it sees) take indices from the upper half of the array, which the host's
  do not reach in practice; a host's object that does comes first.
- Every tick the host sends where its moving objects are (vehicles, items,
  bodies), each client those near its players every tick and those further
  less often, with each as it comes to rest, and to every client a few of
  those at rest, round the lot; a client moves its copies there, a little
  off half of the way each tick, further (or come to rest) drawn gliding from
  where they were rather than jumping (render_interpolation.c).
  A client's own player's vehicle is its own, as its own player's unit is:
  it sends the host where it drives it at which of its ticks, which the host
  takes within what the vehicle can have moved at its next tick, and tells
  the client which of its ticks it has it at; the client moves it by how far
  that is from where it had it at that tick, only when far off.
- Ten times a second, the host sends what a unit carries when that has
  changed (and once a second whatever it is): which weapons, slot for slot,
  their ammunition, the weapon in hand and the grenades; a client moves its
  copies of those weapons in and out of its copies of the units to match (it
  decides no pickups, swaps or drops itself). A change of weapons or
  grenades goes to every client at once, one of ammunition alone to the
  unit's own client at once and to the others as often as the unit's place
  is sent them. A client's own player spends its own ammunition and grenades:
  it takes the host's count only once the host has had a round trip to see
  what it did.
