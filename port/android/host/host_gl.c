/* writes data into the buffer bound to target. The renderer streams a
range per draw, so a frame makes hundreds of these, and the cost per call
rather than per byte is what a frame is made of.

GL_MAP_INVALIDATE_RANGE_BIT was what made that cost ruinous. It tells the
driver the range's previous contents are undefined and must be discarded,
which is the very work GL_MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT exists to avoid: that one
promises the caller that no queued draw is reading the range. Asked to do
both, Adreno pays for the discard - about 0.85 ms a call on a Galaxy Z
Flip 4, whatever the range written - and with a few hundred calls a frame
that came to 96% of a 550 ms frame at 1.8 fps, with the GPU idle throughout.

Without the invalidation the same call is well under a microsecond and the
same game runs at the display's refresh rate. The promise unsynchronized
makes still holds: the renderer only writes ranges that no queued draw reads,
because host_gl_wait_frame releases the ring slot first. */
