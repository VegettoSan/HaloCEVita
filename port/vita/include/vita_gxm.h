/*
VITA_GXM.H

The GXM renderer (port/vita/host/vita_gxm.c, VitaSDK's GCC and ABI) as the
Direct3D device (port/vita/platform/d3d8_gxm.c, the game's ABI) drives it.
Everything crossing here is a 32-bit scalar, a float, a pointer, or a struct
of those, so both ABIs lay it out alike; Direct3D's enumerant values are used
as they are and translated on the GXM side.

Memory the GPU reads (vertices, indices, textures, uniforms) is either in the
contiguous window the host mapped for the GPU at start-up
(vita_host_arena), in the per-frame ring (vgxm_ring_alloc), or in the
texture pool (vgxm_pool_alloc).
