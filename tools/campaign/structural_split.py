"""Board-wide structural-versus-tie split for every non-exact function.

READ-ONLY DIAGNOSTIC. Reads build/split and build/base and writes nothing; it
recompiles nothing and is not part of any build. Added by the Lane A AI-core
lane on 2026-09-20 alongside
docs/object_matching_logs/claude_lane_a_structural_vs_tie_census_20260920.md,
which explains the three tiers, what each does and does not prove, and the three
traps that make a census like this lie.

Tiers: S1 the emitted reference multiset differs; S2 references agree but the
real instruction count differs; T both already agree. Validated against gate.py:
on Lane A's eleven units this reports exactly 33 non-exact functions and gate.py
reports exactly 33 residuals, with no disagreement in either direction. Run that
check first if you extend this. Only T makes "tie" the
default reading, and even S1 is not proof of source-reachability - the backend
can delete a reference by itself (see the cross-jump on
_ai_communication_finished).
