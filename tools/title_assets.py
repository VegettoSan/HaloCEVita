"""Makes high-res textures of the menus' titles (port/assets/titles/*.png):
the screens' headers and the main menu's items, which the maps hold as
pictures of text, set again in a font at 4x their size:

    python tools/title_assets.py --map assets/maps/ui.map

The maps' titles are set in a commercial typeface; they are set here in
OpenCE (port/assets/fonts/OpenCE-Regular.ttf, SIL Open Font License), Roger
White's public-domain Newtown respaced to set them as the maps do
(tools/title_font.py). Each
title keeps the rest of its picture: the text is taken out of the map's
bitmap (filled in from around it), that background (soft plates and glows)
is enlarged, and the text set in the font, in its colour, goes over it.
Where the project has a hand-made SVG redraw of the picture (BACKGROUNDS,
port/assets/titles/svg, needing rsvg-convert), the text goes over the redraw
instead.
Each letter is placed where the old one is (Layout): the text is set with
the font's spacing, moved and tracked as a whole to cover the old text
best, and then each letter is moved by up to four texels, in eighths of a
texel, to cover its old letter best; letters left nearly touching where the
old ones have a gap between them are parted to the old gap. A selected menu
item uses its unselected picture's layout (the same letters, read more
surely). titles.json records where each letter went, which
tools/title_font.py's spacing is measured from.

The pictures are drawn in place of the maps' bitmaps as the high-res HUD's
are (port/linux/src/hud_hires.c), and only for the bitmaps of the English
maps (their CRC), which these texts are. Writes titles.json, which
tools/embed_assets.py embeds with them. Needs Pillow, NumPy and SciPy.
